## 23 庚桑楚 Gengsang chu

老聃之役有庚桑楚者
偏得老聃之道
以北居畏壘之山
Among the attendants of Lao Dan was one Gengsang Chu,
who had mastered a portion of the Way of Lao Dan,
and with it went north to live among the Mountains of Zigzag.

其臣之畫然知者去之
His servants, with their bright and knowing looks,
he discharged;
其妾之挈然仁者遠之
his concubines, with their tender and solicitous ways,
he put far away from him.

擁腫之與居
鞅掌之為使
Instead, he shared his house with drabs and dowdies
and employed the idle and indolent to wait on him.

居三年畏壘大壤
畏壘之民相與言曰
庚桑子之始來
吾洒然異之
He had been living there for three years
when Zigzag began to enjoy bountiful harvests,
and the people of Zigzag said to one another,
"When Master Gengsang first came among us,
we were highly suspicious of him.

今吾日計之而不足
歲計之而有餘
But now, if we figure by the day, there never seems to be enough,
but if we figure by the year, there's always some left over!

庶幾其聖人乎
It might just be that he's a sage!

子胡不相與尸而祝之
社而稷之乎
Why don't we make him
our impersonator of the dead and pray to him,
turn over to him our altars of the soil and grain?"

***

桑子聞之南面而不釋然
When Master Gengsang heard this,
he faced south with a look of displeasure.[^23-1]

弟子異之
庚桑子曰
弟子何異於予
His disciples thought this strange,
but Master Gengsang said,
"Why should you wonder that I am displeased?

夫春氣發而百草生
正得秋而萬寶成
When the breath of spring comes forth,
the hundred grasses begin to grow,
and later, when autumn visits them,
their ten thousand fruits swell and ripen.

夫春與秋豈無得而然哉
Yet how could spring and autumn do other than they do?---
天道已行矣
the Way of Heaven has already set them in motion.

吾聞至人尸居環堵之室
而百姓猖狂不知所如往
I have heard that the Perfect Man dwells corpse-like
in his little four-walled room,
leaving the hundred clans to their uncouth and uncaring ways,
not knowing where they are going, where they are headed.

今以畏壘之細民而竊竊
欲俎豆予于賢人之閒
But now these petty people of Zigzag,
in their officious and busybody fashion,
want to bring their sacrificial stands and platters
and make me one of their 'worthies'!

我其杓之人邪
Am I to be held up as a model for men?

吾是以不釋於老聃之言
That is why, remembering the words of Lao Dan,
I am so displeased!"

***

弟子曰
不然
"But there's no need for that!"
said his disciples.

夫尋常之溝
巨魚無所還其體而鯢鰌為之制
"In a ditch eight or sixteen feet wide,
the really big fish doesn't even have room to turn around,
yet the minnows and loaches think it ample.

步仞之丘陵
巨獸無所隱其軀而㜸狐為之祥
On a knoll no more than five or ten paces in height,
the really big animal doesn't even have room to hide,
yet the wily foxes think it ideal.

且夫尊賢授能
先善與利
Moreover, to honor the worthy and assign office to the able,
according them precedence and conferring benefits on them---
自古堯舜以然
this has been the custom
from the ancient days of the sages Yao and Shun.

而況畏壘之民乎
How much more so, then,
should it be the custom among the common people of Zigzag!

夫子亦聽矣
Why not go ahead and heed their demands, Master?"

***

庚桑子曰
小子來
Master Gengsang said,
"Come nearer, my little ones!

夫函車之獸介而離山則不免於罔罟之患
A beast large enough to gulp down a carriage,
if he sets off alone and leaves the mountains,
cannot escape the perils of net and snare;
吞舟之魚碭而失水則蟻能苦之
a fish large enough to swallow a boat,
if he is tossed up by the waves and left stranded,
is bound to fall victim to ants and crickets.[^23-2]

故鳥獸不厭高
Therefore birds and beasts
don't mind how high they climb to escape danger;
魚鱉不厭深
fish and turtles
don't mind how deep they dive.

夫全其形生之人藏其身也
不厭深眇而已矣
So the man who would preserve his body and life
must think only of how to hide himself away,
not minding how remote or secluded the spot may be.

***

且夫二子者
"And as for those two you mentioned
---Yao and Shun---
又何足以稱揚哉
how are they worthy to be singled out for praise?

是其於辯也
將妄鑿垣牆而殖蓬蒿也
簡髮而櫛
數米而炊
With their nice distinctions,
they are like a man who goes around willfully
poking holes in people's walls and fences
and planting weeds and brambles in them,
like a man who picks out which hairs of his head
he intends to comb before combing it,
who counts the grains of rice
before he cooks them.

竊竊乎
Such bustle and officiousness---
又何足以濟世哉
how can it be of any use in saving the age?

舉賢則民相軋
Promote men of worth
and the people begin trampling over one another;
任知則民相盜
employ men of knowledge
and the people begin filching from one another.

之數物者不足以厚民
Such procedures will do nothing to make the people ingenuous.

民之於利甚勤
子有殺父
臣有殺君
正晝為盜
日中穴杯
Instead, the people will only grow more diligent
in their pursuit of gain till there are
sons who kill their fathers,
ministers who kill their lords,
men who filch at high noon,
who bore holes through walls in broad daylight.

吾語女大亂之本
必生於堯舜之間
I tell you, the source of all great confusion
will invariably be found to lie right there with Yao and Shun!

其末存乎千世之後
And a thousand generations later, it will still be with us.

千世之後
A thousand generations later---
其必
mark my word---
有人與人相食者也
there will be men who will eat one another up!"

***

南榮趎蹴然正坐曰
若趎之年者已長矣
Nanrong Zhu straightened up on his mat
with a perplexed look and said,
"A man like myself who's already on in years---
將惡乎託業以及此言邪
what sort of studies is he to undertake
in order to attain this state you speak of?"

***

庚桑子曰
全汝形
抱汝生
Master Gengsang said,
"Keep the body whole,
cling fast to life!

無使汝思慮營營
Do not fall prey to the fidget and fuss of thoughts and scheming.

若此三年則可以及此言矣
If you do this for three years,
then you can attain the state I have spoken of."

***

南榮趎曰
目之與形
Nanrong Zhu said,
"The eyes are part of the body---
吾不知其異也
I have never thought them anything else---
而盲者不能自見
yet the blind man cannot see with his.

耳之與形
The ears are part of the body---
吾不知其異也
I have never thought them anything else---
而聾者不能自聞
yet the deaf man cannot hear with his.

心之與形
The mind is part of the body---
吾不知其異也
I have never thought it anything else---
而狂者不能自得
yet the madman cannot comprehend with his.

形之與形
The body, too, must be part of the body---
亦辟矣
surely they are intimately connected.[^23-3]

而物或閒之邪
Yet---is it because something intervenes?---
欲相求而不能相得
I try to seek my body, but I cannot find it.

今謂趎曰
全汝形
抱汝生
Now you tell me,
'Keep the body whole,
cling fast to life!

勿使汝思慮營營
Do not fall prey to the fidget and fuss of thoughts and scheming.'

趎勉聞道達耳矣
As hard as I try to understand your explanation of the Way,
I'm afraid your words penetrate no farther than my ears."[^23-4]

***

庚桑子曰
辭盡矣
"I've said all I can say,"
exclaimed Master Gengsang.

曰奔蜂不能化藿蠋
"The saying goes,
mud daubers have no power to transform caterpillars.[^23-5]

越雞不能伏鵠卵魯雞固能矣
The little hens of Yue cannot hatch goose eggs,
though the larger hens of Lu can do it well enough.

雞之與雞
其德非不同也
It isn't that one kind of hen
isn't just as henlike as the other.

有能有不能者
其才固有巨小也
One can and the other can't
because their talents just naturally differ in size.

今吾才小不足以化子
Now I'm afraid my talents
are not sufficient to bring about any transformation in you.

子胡不南見老子
Why don't you go south and visit Laozi?"

***

南榮趎贏糧
七日七夜至老子之所
Nanrong Zhu packed up his provisions
and journeyed for seven days and seven nights
until he came to Laozi's place.

老子曰
子自楚之所來乎
Laozi said,
"Did you come from Gengsang Chu's place?"

***

南榮趎曰
唯
"Yes, sir,"
said Nanrong Zhu.

***

老子曰
子何與人偕來之眾也
"Why did you come with all this crowd of people?"
asked Laozi.

***

南榮趎懼然顧其後
Nanrong Zhu, astonished, turned to look behind him.

***

老子曰
子不知吾所謂乎
"Don't you know what I mean?"
asked Laozi.

***

南榮趎俯而慚仰而歎曰
今者吾忘吾答
因失吾問
Nanrong Zhu hung his head in shame and then,
looking up with a sigh, said,
"Now I've even forgotten the right answer to that,
so naturally I can't ask any questions of my own."

***

老子曰
何謂也
"What does *that* mean?"
asked Laozi.

***

南榮趎曰
不知乎人謂我朱愚
"If I say I don't know,
then people will call me an utter fool,"
said Nanrong Zhu.

知乎反愁我軀
"But if I say I do know, then, on the contrary,
I will bring worry on myself.

不仁則害人
If I am not benevolent,
I will harm others;
仁則反愁我身
but if I am benevolent, then, on the contrary,
I will make trouble for myself.

不義則傷彼
If I am not righteous,
I will do injury to others;
義則反愁我已
but if I am righteous, then, on the contrary,
I will distress myself.

我安逃此而可
How can I possibly escape from this state of affairs?

此三言者趎之所患也願因楚而問之
It is these three dilemmas that are harassing me,
and so through Gengsang Chu's introduction,
I have come to beg an explanation."

***

老子曰
向吾見若眉睫之間
吾因以得汝矣
Laozi said,
"A moment ago, when I looked at the space
between your eyebrows and eyelashes,
I could tell what kind of person you are.

今汝又言而信之
And now what you have said confirms it.

若規規然若喪父母
揭竿而求諸海也
You are confused and crestfallen
as though you had lost your father and mother
and were setting off with a pole to fish for them in the sea.

女亡人哉
You are a lost man---
惘惘乎汝欲反汝情性而無由入
hesitant and unsure,
you want to return to your true form and inborn nature,
but you have no way to go about it---
可憐哉
a pitiful sight indeed!"

***

南榮趎請入就舍
Nanrong Zhu asked to be allowed to repair to his quarters.

召其所好
去其所惡
There he tried to cultivate his good qualities
and rid himself of his bad ones;
十日自愁復見老子
and after ten days of making himself miserable,
he went to see Laozi again.

老子曰
汝自洒濯
Laozi said,
"You have been very diligent in your washing and purifying---
熟哉鬱鬱乎
as I can see from your scrubbed and shining look.

然而其中津津乎
But there is still something smoldering away inside you---
猶有惡也
it would seem that there are bad things there yet.

夫外韄者
不可繁而捉將內揵
When outside things trip you up
and you can't snare and seize them,
then bar the inside gate.

內韄者
不可繆而捉將外揵
When inside things trip you up
and you can't bind and seize them,
then bar the outside gate.

外內韄者
道德不能持
If both outside and inside things trip you up,
then even the Way and its virtue themselves can't keep you going---
而況放道而行者乎
much less one who is a mere follower of the Way in his actions."[^23-6]

***

南榮趎曰
里人有病
里人問之
病者能言其病
然其病病者
Nanrong Zhu said,
"When a villager gets sick
and his neighbors ask him how he feels,
if he is able to describe his illness,
it means he can still recognize his illness as an illness---
猶未病也
and so he isn't all that ill.

若趎之聞大道
譬猶飲藥以加病也
But now, if I were to ask about the Great Way,
it would be like drinking medicine that made me sicker than before.

趎願聞衛生之經而已矣
What I would like to ask about
is simply the basic rule of life preservation, that is all."

***

老子曰
衛生之經
Laozi said,
"Ah---the basic rule of life preservation.

能抱一乎
Can you embrace the One?

能勿失乎
Can you keep from losing it?

能無卜筮而知吉凶乎
Can you, without tortoise shell or divining stalks,
foretell fortune and misfortune?

能止乎
Do you know where to stop;
能已乎
do you know where to leave off?

能舍諸人而求諸己乎
Do you know how to disregard it in others
and instead look for it in yourself?

能翛然乎
Can you be brisk and unflagging?

能侗然乎
Can you be rude and unwitting?

能兒子乎
Can you be a little baby?

兒子終日嗥而嗌不嗄
The baby howls all day, yet its throat never gets hoarse---
和之至也
harmony at its height![^23-7]

終日握而手不掜
The baby makes fists all day, yet its fingers never get cramped---
共其德也
virtue is all it holds to.

終日視而目不瞚
The baby stares all day without blinking its eyes---
偏不在外也
it has no preferences in the world of externals.

行不知所之
居不知所為
與物委蛇而同其波
To move without knowing where you are going,
to sit at home without knowing what you are doing,
traipsing and trailing about with other things,
riding along with them on the same wave---
是衛生之經已
this is the basic rule of life preservation,
this and nothing more."

***

榮趎曰
然則是至人之德已乎
Nanrong Zhu said,
"Then is this all there is to the virtue of the Perfect Man?"

***

曰非也
"Oh, no!

是乃所謂冰解凍釋者
This is merely what is called
the freeing of the ice bound,
the thawing of the frozen.

能乎
Can you do it?[^23-8]

夫至人者相與交食乎地而交樂乎天
The Perfect Man joins with others
in seeking his food from the earth,
his pleasures in Heaven.

不以人物利害相攖
But he does not become embroiled with them
in questions of people and things,
profit and loss.

不相與為怪
He does not join them in their shady doings;
不相與為謀
he does not join them in their plots;
不相與為事
he does not join them in their projects.

翛然而往
Brisk and unflagging, he goes;
侗然而來
rude and unwitting, he comes.

是謂衛生之經已
This is what is called the basic rule of life preservation."

***

曰然則是至乎
"Then is this the highest stage?"

***

曰未也
"Not yet!

吾固告汝曰
能兒子乎
Just a moment ago I said to you,
'Can you be a baby?'

兒子
動不知所為
行不知所之
The baby acts without knowing what it is doing,
moves without knowing where it is going.

身若槁木之枝而心若死灰
Its body is like the limb of a withered tree,
its mind like dead ashes.

若是者
禍亦不至
福亦不來
Since it is so,
no bad fortune will ever touch it,
and no good fortune will come to it, either.

福無有惡有人災也
And if it is free from good and bad fortune,
then what human suffering can it undergo?"

---

宇泰定者發乎天光
He whose inner being rests in the Great Serenity
will send forth a Heavenly light.

發乎天光者人見其人［物見其物］[^rse-23-1]
But though he sends forth a Heavenly light,
men will see him as a man,
and things will see him as a thing.

人有修者
乃今有恆
When a man has trained himself to this degree,
then for the first time, he achieves constancy.

有恆者
人舍之
天助之
Because he possesses constancy,
men will come to lodge with him,
and Heaven will be his helper.

人之所舍謂之天民
Those whom men come to lodge with
may be called the people of Heaven;

天之所助謂之天子
those whom Heaven aids
may be called the sons of Heaven.

***

學者學其所不能學也
Learning means learning what cannot be learned;
行者行其所不能行也
practicing means practicing what cannot be practiced;
辯者辯其所不能辯也
discriminating means discriminating what cannot be discriminated.

知止乎其所不能知至矣
Understanding that rests in
what it cannot understand is the finest.[^23-9]

若有不即是者天鈞敗之
If you do not attain this goal,
then Heaven the Equalizer will destroy you.

***

備物以將形
Utilize the bounty of things
and let them nourish your body;
藏不虞以生心
withdraw into thoughtlessness,
and in this way give life to your mind;
敬中以達彼
be reverent of what is within
and extend this same reverence to others.

若是而萬惡至者皆天也而非人也
If you do these things and yet are visited by ten thousand evils,
then all are Heaven sent and not the work of man.

不足以滑成
They should not be enough to destroy your composure;
不可內於靈臺
they must not be allowed to enter the Spirit Tower.[^23-10]

靈臺者有持
而不知其所持
而不可持者也
The Spirit Tower has its guardian,
but unless it understands who its guardian is,
it cannot be guarded.

***

不見其誠己而發
每發而不當
If you do not perceive the sincerity within yourself
and yet try to move forth,
each movement will miss the mark.

業入而不舍
每更為失
If outside concerns enter and are not expelled,
each movement will only add failure to failure.

為不善乎顯明之中者人得而誅之
He who does what is not good in clear and open view
will be seized and punished by men.

為不善乎幽閒之中者鬼得而誅之
He who does what is not good in the shadow of darkness
will be seized and punished by ghosts.

明乎人
明乎鬼者
然後能獨行
Only he who clearly understands both men and ghosts
will be able to walk alone.[^23-11]

***

券內者行乎無名
He who concentrates on the internal
does deeds that bring no fame.

券外者志乎期費
He who concentrates on the external
sets his mind on the hoarding of goods.[^23-12]

行乎無名者唯庸有光
He who does deeds that bring no fame
is forever the possessor of light.

志乎期費者唯賈人也
He who sets his mind on the hoarding of goods
is a mere merchant.

人見其跂
猶之魁然
To other men's eyes,
he seems to be straining on tiptoe in his greed,
yet he thinks himself a splendid fellow.

與物窮者物入焉
If a man goes along with things to the end,
then things will come to him.

與物且者其身之不能容
焉能容人
But if he sets up barriers against things, then he will
not be able to find room enough even for himself,
much less for others.

不能容人者無親
無親者盡人
He who can find no room for others lacks fellow feeling,
and to him who lacks fellow feeling, all men are strangers.

兵莫憯於志
There is no weapon more deadly than the will---
鏌鋣為下
even Moye is inferior to it.[^23-13]

寇莫大於陰陽
There are no enemies greater than the yin and yang---
無所逃於天地之間
because nowhere between heaven and earth
can you escape from them.

非陰陽賊之
It is not that the yin and yang deliberately do you evil---
心則使之也
it is your own mind that makes them act so.[^23-14]

***

道通
The Way permeates all things.

其分也其成也
Their dividedness is their completeness;
［成也］毀也[^rse-23-2]
their completeness is their impairment.[^23-15]

所惡
乎分者其分也以備
What is hateful about this state of dividedness
is that men take their dividedness and seek to supplement it;
所以惡乎備者其有以備
and what is hateful about attempts to supplement it
is that they are a mere supplementation of what men already have.

故出而不反
So they go forth and forget to return---
見其鬼
they act as though they had seen a ghost.

出而得
They go forth and claim to have gotten something---
是謂得死
what they have gotten is the thing called death.

滅而有實
They are wiped out and choked off---
鬼之一也
already a kind of ghost themselves.

以有形者象無形者而定矣
Only when that which has form
learns to imitate the formless will it find serenity.

***

出無本
入無竅
It comes out from no source,
it goes back in through no aperture.

有實而無乎處
It has reality yet no place where it resides;
有長而無乎本剽
it has duration yet no beginning or end.

有所出而無竅者
Something emerges, though through no aperture---
有實
this refers to the fact that it has reality.

有實而無乎處者
It has reality, yet there is no place where it resides---
宇也
this refers to the dimension of space.

有長而無本剽者
It has duration but no beginning or end---
宙也
this refers to the dimension of time.

有乎生
有乎死
有乎出
有乎入
There is life,
there is death,
there is a coming out,
there is a going back in---
入出而無見其形
yet in the coming out and going back,
its form is never seen.[^23-16]

是謂天門
This is called the Heavenly Gate.

天門者無有也
The Heavenly Gate is nonbeing.

萬物出乎無有
The ten thousand things come forth from nonbeing.

有不能以有為有
Being cannot create being out of being;
必出乎無有
inevitably it must come forth from nonbeing.

而無有一無有聖人藏乎是
Nonbeing is absolute nonbeing,
and it is here that the sage hides himself.

***

古之人其知有所至矣
The understanding of the men of ancient times went a long way.

惡乎至
How far did it go?

有以為未始有物者
To the point where some of them believed
that things have never existed---
至矣盡矣
弗可以加矣
so far, to the end,
where nothing can be added.

其次以為有物矣
Those at the next stage thought that things exist.[^23-17]

將以生為喪也
以死為反也
They looked on life as a loss,
on death as a return---
是以分已
thus they had already entered the state of dividedness.

其次曰
始無有
Those at the next stage said,
"In the beginning, there was nonbeing.

既而有生
生俄而死
Later there was life,
and when there was life, suddenly there was death.

以無有為首
以生為體
以死為尻
We look on nonbeing as the head,
on life as the body,
on death as the rump.

孰知有無死生之一守者
Who knows that being and nonbeing, life and death,
are a single way?[^23-18]

吾與之為友
I will be his friend!"

***

是三者雖異公族也
These three groups, while differing in their viewpoint,
belong to the same royal clan;
昭景也著戴也
甲氏也著封也
非一也
though, as in the case
of the Zhao and Jing families,
whose names indicate their line of succession,
and that of the Qu family,
whose name derives from its fief,
they are not identical.[^23-19]

***

有生黬也
Out of the murk, 
things come to life.

披然曰
移是
With cunning, you declare,
"We must analyze this!"

嘗言移是非所言也
You try putting your analysis in words,
though it is not something to be put into words.

雖然不可知者也
You cannot, however, attain understanding.

臘者之有膍胲
可散而不可散也
At the winter sacrifice,
you can point to the tripe or the hoof of the sacrificial ox,
which can be considered separate things
and yet, in a sense,
cannot be considered separate.

觀室者周於寢廟
又適其偃焉
A man who goes to look at a house
walks all around the chambers and ancestral shrines,
but he also goes to inspect the privies.

為是舉移是
And so for this reason, you launch into your analysis.[^23-20]

***

請嘗言移是
Let me try describing this analysis of yours.

是以生為本
以知為師
因以乘是非
It takes life as its basis
and knowledge as its teacher and,
from there, proceeds to assign "right" and "wrong."

果有名實
因以己為質
So in the end, we have "names" and "realities,"
and accordingly each man considers himself to be their arbiter.

使人以己為節
因以死償節
In his efforts to make other men appreciate his devotion to duty,
for example, he will go so far as to accept death
as his reward for devotion.

若然者
以用為知
To such men,
he who is useful is considered wise;
以不用為愚
he who is of no use is considered stupid.

以徹為名
He who is successful wins renown;
以窮為辱
he who runs into trouble is heaped with shame.

移是今之人也
Analyzers---that is what the men of today are![^23-21]

是蜩與學鳩同於同也
They are like the cicada and the little dove
who agreed because they were two of a kind.[^23-22]

***

蹍市人之足則辭以放驁
If you step on a stranger's foot in the marketplace,
you apologize at length for your carelessness.

兄則以嫗
大親則已矣
If you step on your older brother's foot,
you give him an affectionate pat,
and if you step on your parent's foot,
you know you are already forgiven.

故曰
至禮有不人
So it is said,
perfect ritual makes no distinction of persons;
至義不物
perfect righteousness takes no account of things;
至知不謀
perfect knowledge does not scheme;
至仁無親
perfect benevolence knows no affection;
至信辟金
perfect trust dispenses with gold.[^23-23]

***

徹志之勃
Wipe out the delusions of the will;
解心之繆
undo the snares of the heart;
去德之累
rid yourself of the entanglements to virtue;
達道之塞
open up the roadblocks in the Way.

富貴
顯嚴
名利
Eminence and wealth,
recognition and authority,
fame and profit---
六者勃志也
these six are the delusions of the will.

容動
色理
氣意
Appearances and carriage,
complexion and features,
temperament and attitude---
六者繆心也
these six are the snares of the heart.

惡欲
喜怒
哀樂
Loathing and desire,
joy and anger,
grief and happiness---
六者累德也
these six are the entanglements of virtue.

去就
取與
知能
Rejecting and accepting,
taking and giving,
knowledge and ability---
六者塞道也
these six are the roadblocks of the Way.

此四六者不盪胸中則正
When these four sixes no longer seethe within the breast,
then you will achieve uprightness;
正則靜
being upright, you will be still;
靜則明
being still, you will be enlightened;
明則虛
being enlightened, you will be empty;
虛則無為而無不為也
and being empty, you will do nothing,
and yet there will be nothing that is not done.

***

道者德之欽也
The Way is virtue's idol.

生者德之光也
Life is virtue's light.

性者生之質也
The in-born nature is the substance of life.

性之動謂之為
The inborn nature in motion is called action.

為之偽謂之失
Action that has become artificial is called loss.

知者接也
知者謨也
Understanding reaches out,
understanding plots.

知者之所不知猶睨也
But the understanding of that which is not to be understood
is a childlike stare.

動以不得已之謂德
Action that is done because one cannot do otherwise
is called virtue.

動無非我之謂治
Action in which there is nothing other than self
is called good order.

名相反而實相順也
In definition, the two seem to be opposites,
but in reality they agree.

***

羿工乎中微而拙於使人無己譽
Archer Yi was skilled at hitting the smallest target
but clumsy in not preventing people from praising him for it.

聖人工乎天而拙乎人
The sage is skilled in what pertains to Heaven
but clumsy in what pertains to man.

夫工乎天而俍乎人者
To be skilled in Heavenly affairs
and good at human ones as well---
唯全人能之
only the Complete Man can encompass that.

唯蟲能蟲
唯蟲能天
Only bugs can be bugs
because only bugs can abide by Heaven.

全人惡天
惡人之天
The Complete Man hates Heaven
and hates the Heavenly in man.

而況吾天乎人乎
How much more, then,
does he hate the "I" who distinguishes
between Heaven and man.[^23-24]

***

一雀適羿羿必得之
If a single sparrow came within Archer Yi's range,
he was sure to bring it down---
威也
impressive shooting.

以天下為之籠則雀無所逃
But he might have made the whole world into a cage,
and then the sparrows would have had no place to flee to.

是故湯以胞人籠伊尹
秦穆公以五羊之皮籠百里奚
That was the way it was when Tang caged Yi Yin
by making him a cook
and Duke Mu caged Boli Xi
for the price of five ram skins.[^23-25]

是故非以其所好籠之而可得者無有也
But if you hope to get a man,
you must cage him with what he likes,
or you will never succeed.

***

介者拸畫
The man who has had his feet cut off in punishment
discards his fancy clothes---
外非譽也
because praise and blame no longer touch him.

胥靡登高而不懼
The chained convict climbs the highest peak without fear---
遺死生也
because he has abandoned all thought of life and death.

夫復謵不餽而忘人
忘人因以為天人矣
These two are submissive[^23-26] and un-ashamed
because they have forgotten other men,
and by forgetting other men, they have become men of Heaven.

故敬之而不喜
Therefore you may treat such men with respect,
and they will not be pleased;
侮之而不怒者
you may treat them with contumely,
and they will not be angry.

唯同乎天和者為然
Only because they are one with the Heavenly Harmony
can they be like this.

***

出怒不怒則怒出於不怒矣
If he who bursts out in anger is not really angry,
then his anger is an outburst of nonanger.

出為無為則為出於無為矣
If he who launches into action is not really acting,
then his action is a launching into inaction.

欲靜則平氣
He who wishes to be still must calm his energies;
欲神則順心
he who wishes to be spiritual must compose his mind;
有為也欲當則緣於不得已
he who in his actions wishes to hit the mark
must go along with what he cannot help doing.

不得已之類
Those things that you cannot help doing---
聖人之道
they represent the Way of the sage.
