## 33 天下 The world

天下之治方術者多矣
皆以其有為不可加矣
Many are the men in the world
who apply themselves to doctrines and policies,
and each believes he has something
that cannot be improved on.

古之所謂道術者
What in ancient times was called the "art of the Way'---
果惡乎在
where does it exist?

曰無乎不在
I say, there is no place it does not exist.

曰神何由降
明何由出
But, you ask, where does holiness descend from,
where does enlightenment emerge from?

聖有所生
王有所成
皆原於一
The sage gives them birth,
the king completes them,
and all have their source in the One.

不離於宗謂之天人
He who does not depart from the Ancestor
is called the Heavenly Man;
不離於精謂之神人
he who does not depart from the Pure
is called the Holy Man;
不離於真謂之至人
he who does not depart from the True
is called the Perfect Man.

***

以天為宗
以德為本
以道為門
兆於變化
To make Heaven his source,
Virtue his root,
and the Way his gate,
revealing himself through change and transformation---
謂之聖人
one who does this is called a Sage.

***

以仁為恩
以義為理
以禮為行
以樂為和
薰然慈仁
To make benevolence his standard of kindness,
righteousness his model of reason,
ritual his guide to conduct,
and music his source of harmony,
serene in mercy and benevolence---
謂之君子
one who does this is called a gentleman.

***

以法為分
以名為表
以參為驗
以稽為決
其數一二三四
是也百官以此相齒
To employ laws to determine functions,
names to indicate rank,
comparisons to discover actual performance,
investigations to arrive at decisions,
checking them off, one, two, three, four,
and in this way to assign the hundred officials to their ranks;

以事為常
以衣食為主
蕃息畜藏老弱孤寡為意
皆有以養
to keep a constant eye on administrative affairs,
give first thought to food and clothing,
keep in mind the need to produce and grow,
to shepherd and store away,
to provide for the old and the weak,
the orphan and the widow,
so that all are properly nourished---
民之理也
these are the principles by which the people are ordered.[^33-1]

***

古之人其備乎
How thorough were the men of ancient times!---
配神明醇天地
育萬物和天下
澤及百姓
companions of holiness and enlightenment,
pure as Heaven and earth,
caretakers of the ten thousand things,
harmonizers of the world,
their bounty extended to the hundred clans.

明於本數
係於末度
They had a clear understanding of basic policies
and paid attention even to petty regulations---
六通四辟
小大精粗
其運無乎不在
in the six avenues and the four frontiers,
in what was great or small, coarse or fine,
there was no place they did not move.

***

其明而在數度者
舊法世傳之史尚多有之
The wisdom that was embodied in their policies and regulations
is, in many cases, still reflected
in the old laws and records of the historiographers
handed down over the ages.

其在於詩書禮樂者
鄒魯之士搢紳先生多能明之
As to that which is recorded in
the _Book of Odes_ and _Book of Documents_,
the _Ritual_ and the _Music_,
there are many gentlemen of Zou and Lu,
scholars of sash and official rank,
who have an understanding of it.

詩以道志
The _Book of Odes_ describes the will;
書以道事
the _Book of Documents_ describes events;
禮以道行
the _Ritual_ speaks of conduct;
樂以道和
the _Music_ speaks of harmony;
易以道陰陽
the _Book of Changes_ describes the yin and yang;
春秋以道名分
the _Spring and Autumn Annals_ describes titles and functions.[^33-2]

***

其數散於天下而設於中國者
百家之學時或稱而道之
These various policies are scattered throughout the world
and are propounded in the Middle Kingdom,
the scholars of the hundred schools from time to time
taking up one or the other in their praises and preachings.

天下大亂
賢聖不明
道德不一
But the world is in great disorder,
the worthies and sages lack clarity of vision,
and the Way and its Virtue are no longer One.

天下多得一察焉以自好
So the world too often seizes on one of its aspects,
examines it,
and pronounces it good.

譬如耳目鼻口
But it is like the case of the ear, the eye, the nose, and the mouth:
皆有所明不能相通
each has its own kind of understanding,
but their functions are not interchangeable.
猶百家眾技也
皆有所長
時有所用
In the same way, the various skills of the hundred schools
all have their strong points,
and at times each may be of use.

雖然不該不遍
But none is wholly sufficient,
none is universal.
一曲之士也
判天地之美
析萬物之理
察古人之全
寡能備於
天地之美
稱神明之容
The scholar cramped in one corner of learning
tries to judge the beauty of Heaven and earth,
to pry into the principles of the ten thousand things,
to scrutinize the perfection of the ancients,
but seldom is he able to encompass
the true beauty of Heaven and earth,
to describe the true face of holy brightness.

是故內聖外王之道
闇而不明
鬱而不發
Therefore the Way that is sagely within and kingly without
has fallen into darkness and is no longer clearly perceived,
has become shrouded and no longer shines forth.

天下之人各為其所欲焉以自為方
The men of the world all follow their own desires
and make these their "doctrine."

悲夫
How sad!---
百家往而不反必不合矣
the hundred schools going on and on instead of turning back,
fated never to join again.

後世之學者不幸不見
天地之純
古人之大體
道術將為天下裂
The scholars of later ages have unfortunately never perceived
the purity of Heaven and earth,
the great body of the ancients,
and "the art of the Way" in time comes to be
rent and torn apart by the world.

---

不侈於後世
不靡於萬物
不暉於數度
以繩墨自矯而備世之急
To teach no extravagance to later ages,
to leave the ten thousand things unadorned,
to shun any glorification of rules and regulations,
instead applying ink and measuring line
to the correction of one's own conduct,
thus aiding the world in time of crisis---
古之道術有在於是者
there were those in ancient times who believed
that the "art of the Way" lay in these things.

墨翟禽滑釐聞其風而說之
為之大過
己之大循
Mo Di and Qin Guli heard of their views
and delighted in them,
but they followed them to excess
and were too assiduous in applying them to themselves.

***

作為非樂
命之曰節用
生不歌
死無服
Mozi wrote a piece "Against Music,"
and another entitled "Moderation in Expenditure",
declaring there was to be no singing in life,
no mourning in death.[^33-3]

墨子汎愛兼利而非鬥其道不怒
With a boundless love and a desire to ensure universal benefit,
he condemned warfare, and there was no place in his teachings for anger.

又好學而博不異
Again, he was fond of learning and broad in knowledge and,
in this respect, did not differ from others.

不與先王同毀古之禮樂
His views, however, were not always in accordance
with those of the former kings,
for he denounced the rites and music of antiquity.

黃帝有咸池
堯有大章
舜有大韶
禹有大夏
湯有大濩
文王有辟雍之樂
武王周公作武
The Yellow Emperor had his Xianchi music,
Yao his Dazhong,
Shun his Dashao,
Yu his Daxia,
Tang his Dahuo,
and King Wen the music of the Biyong,
while King Wu and the Duke of Zhou fashioned the Wu music.

古之喪禮
貴賤有儀
上下有等
The mourning rites of antiquity
prescribed the ceremonies appropriate for eminent and humble,
the different regulations for superior and inferior.

天子棺槨七重
The inner and outer coffins of the Son of Heaven
were to consist of seven layers;
諸侯五重
those of the feudal lords, five layers;
大夫三重
those of the high ministers, three layers;
士再重
those of the officials, two layers.

今墨子獨
生不歌
死不服
Yet Mozi alone declares there is to be
no singing in life,
no mourning in death.

桐棺三寸而無槨
A coffin of paulownia wood three inches thick,
with no outer shell---
以為法式
this is his rule, his ideal.

以此教人
恐不愛人
If he teaches men in this fashion,
then I fear he has no love for them;
以此自行固不愛己
and if he adopts such practices for his own burial,
then he surely has no love for himself!

未敗墨子道
I do not mean to discredit his teachings entirely;
雖然歌而非歌
and yet men want to sing, and he says, "No singing!";
哭而非哭
they want to wail, and he says, "No wailing!";
［樂而非樂］
\[they want to play music, and he says, "No music!"][^rse-33-1]---
是果類乎
one wonders if he is in fact human at all.

其生也勤
其死也薄
A life that is all toil,
a death shoddily disposed of---
其道大觳
it is a way that goes too much against us.

使人憂
使人悲
To make men anxious,
to make them sorrowful---
其行難為也
恐其不可以為聖人之道
such practices are hard to carry out,
and I fear they cannot be regarded as the Way of the Sage.

反天下之心天下不堪
They are contrary to the hearts of the world,
and the world cannot endure them.

墨子雖能獨任奈天下何
Though Mozi himself may be capable of such endurance,
how can the rest of the world do likewise?

離於天下其去王也遠矣
Departing so far from the ways of the world,
they must be far removed indeed from those of the true king.

***

墨子稱道曰
昔者禹之湮洪水決江河而通四夷九州也
名山三百支川三千小者無數
Mozi defends his teachings by saying,
"In ancient times, when Yu dammed the flood waters
and opened up the courses of the Yangtze and the Yellow River
so that they flowed through the lands
of the four barbarians and the nine provinces,
joining with the three hundred famous rivers,[^33-4]
their three thousand tributaries,
and the little streams too numerous to count---
禹親自操稿耜而九雜天下之川
腓無胈脛無毛
at that time Yu in person carried the basket and wielded the spade,
gathering together and mingling the rivers of the world
till there was no down left on his calves,
no hair on his shins;
沐甚雨櫛疾風置萬國
the drenching rains washed his locks,
the sharp winds combed them while he worked
to establish the ten thousand states.

禹大聖也而形勞天下也如此
Yu was a great sage,
yet with his own body he labored for the world in such fashion!"

使後世之墨者多
以裘褐為衣
以跂蹻為服
日夜不休
以自苦為極
So it is that many of the Mohists of later ages
dress in skins and coarse cloth,
wear wooden clogs or hempen sandals,
never resting day or night,
driving themselves on to the most bitter exertions.

曰不能如此非禹之道也不足謂墨
"If we cannot do the same," they say,
"then we are not following the way of Yu,
and are unworthy to be called Mohists!"

***

相里勤之弟
子五侯之徒
南方之墨者苦獲已齒鄧陵子之屬
俱誦墨經而倍譎不同
相謂別墨
The disciples of Xiangli Qin,
the followers of Wu Hou,
and the Mohists of the south
such as Ku Huo, Ji Chi, Deng Lingzi, and their like
all recite the Mohist canon,
and yet they quarrel and disagree in their interpretations,
calling one another "Mohist factionalists."

以堅白同異之辯相訾
In their discussions of "hard" and "white,"
"difference" and "sameness,"
they attack back and forth;
以觭偶不仵之辭相應
in their disquisitions on the incompatibility of "odd" and "even,"
they exchange volleys of refutation.[^33-5]

以巨子為聖人
皆願為之尸冀得為其後世
至今不決
They regard the Grand Master of their sect as a sage,
each sect trying to make its Grand Master
the recognized head of the school
in hopes that his authority will be acknowledged by later ages,
but down to the present the dispute remains unresolved.[^33-6]

***

墨翟禽滑釐
之意則是
其行則非也
將使後世之墨者必自苦
以腓無胈脛無毛
Mo Di and Qin Guli
were right in their ideas
but wrong in their practices,
with the result that the Mohists of later ages
have felt obliged to subject themselves to hardship
"till there is no down left on their calves, no hair on their shins"---
相進而已矣
their only thought being to outdo one another.

亂之上也治之下也
Such efforts represent the height of confusion,
the lowest degree of order.

雖然墨子真天下之好也
Nevertheless, Mozi was one who had a true love for the world.

將求之不得也
雖枯槁不舍也
He failed to achieve all he aimed for,
yet, wasted and worn with exhaustion,
he never ceased trying.

才士也
He was indeed a gentleman of ability!

---

夫不累於俗
不飾於物
不苟於人
不忮於眾
願天下之安寧以活民命
人我之養畢足而止以此白心
To be unsnared by vulgar ways,
to make no vain show of material things,
to bring no hardship on others,[^33-7]
to avoid offending the mob,
to seek peace and security for the world,
preservation of the people's lives,
full provender for others as well as oneself,
and to rest content when these aims are fulfilled,
in this way bringing purity to the heart---
古之道術有在於是者
there were those in ancient times who believed
that the "art of the Way" lay in these things.

宋鈃尹文聞其風而悅之
Song Jian[^33-8] and Yin Wen heard of their views
and delighted in them.

作為華山之冠以自表
They fashioned caps in the shape of Mount Hua
to be their mark of distinction.[^33-9]

接萬物以別宥為始
In dealing with the ten thousand things,
they took the "defining of boundaries"
to be their starting point;[^33-10]
語心之容
命之曰心之行
以聏合驩
以調海內
they preached liberality of mind,[^33-11]
which they called "the mind's activity," hoping thereby
to bring men together in the joy of harmony,
to ensure concord within the four seas.

請欲置之以為主
Their chief task lay, they felt,
in the effort to establish these ideals.

見侮不辱救民之鬥
禁攻寢兵救世之戰
They regarded it as no shame to suffer insult
but sought to put an end to strife among the people,
to outlaw aggression, to abolish the use of arms,
and to rescue the world from warfare.

以此周行天下上說下教
雖天下不取強聒而不舍者也故曰
上下見厭而強見也
With these aims they walked the whole world over,
trying to persuade those above them and to teach those below,
and though the world refused to listen,
they clamored all the louder and would not give up until men said,
"High and low are sick of the sight of them,
and still they demand to be seen!"

***

雖然其為人太多
其自為太少
Nevertheless, they took too much thought for others
and too little for themselves.

曰請欲固置五升之飯足矣
先生恐不得飽
"Just give us five pints of rice and that will be enough," they said,
though at that rate I fear these teachers did not get their fill.

弟子雖飢不忘天下
日夜不休曰
我必得活哉
Though their own disciples went hungry, however,
they never forgot the rest of the world
but continued day and night without stop, saying,
"We are determined to make certain that all men can live!"

圖傲乎救世之士哉
How lofty their aims,
these saviors of the world!

曰君子
不為苛察
Again they said,
"The gentleman does not examine others with too harsh an eye;
不以身假物
he does not need material things in which to dress himself."

以為無益於天下者
明之不如已也
If a particular line of inquiry
seemed to bring no benefit to the world,
they thought it better to abandon it
than to seek an understanding of it.

以禁攻寢兵
To outlaw aggression and abolish the use of arms---
為外
these were their external aims.

以情欲寡淺
To lessen the desires and weaken the emotions---
為內
these were their internal aims.

其小大精粗
其行適至
Whether their approach was large scaled or small, detailed or gross,
these were the goals they sought---
是而止
these and nothing more.

---

公而不當
易而無私
決然無主
趣物而不兩
不顧於慮
不謀於知
於物無擇與之俱往
Public-spirited and not partisan,
even-minded and not given to favoritism,
vacant eyed, with none for a master,
trailing after things without a second thought,
giving not a glance to schemes,
not a moment of speculation to knowledge,
choosing neither this thing nor that,
but going along with all of them---
古之道術有在於是者
there were those in ancient times who believed
that the "art of the Way" lay in such things.

彭蒙田駢慎到聞其風而說之
Peng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shen Dao heard of their views
and delighted in them.[^33-12]

齊萬物以為首
The Way, they believed,
lay in making the ten thousand things equal.[^33-13]

曰天能覆之而不能載之
"Heaven is capable of sheltering but not of bearing up," they said.

地能載之而不能覆之
"Earth is capable of bearing up
but not of sheltering.

大道能包之而不能辯之
The Great Way is capable of embracing all things
but not of discriminating among them." [^33-14]

知萬物皆
有所可
有所不可
From this they deduced that each of the ten thousand things
has that which is acceptable in it
and that which is not acceptable.

故曰
選則不遍
Therefore they said,
"To choose is to forgo universality;
教則不至
to compare things[^33-15] is to fail to reach the goal.

道則無遺者矣
The Way has nothing that is left out of it."

***

是故慎到棄知去己而緣不得已
泠汰於物以為道理
For this reason, Shen Dao
discarded knowledge, did away with self,
followed what he could not help but follow,
acquiescent and unmeddling where things were concerned,
taking this to be the principle of the Way.

曰知不知將薄知而後鄰傷之者也
"To know is not to know," he said,
and so he despised knowledge
and worked to destroy and slough it off.

謑髁無任而笑天下之尚賢也
Listless and lackadaisical,[^33-16] he accepted no responsibilities
but laughed at the world for honoring worthy men.

縱脫無行而非天下之大聖
Casual and un-inhibited, he did nothing to distinguish himself
but disparaged the great sages of the world.

椎拍輐斷與物宛轉
Lopping off corners, chiseling away the rough places,
he went tumbling and turning along with things.

舍是與非苟可以免
He put aside both right and wrong
and somehow managed to stay out of trouble.

不師知慮
不知前後
魏然而已矣
With nothing to learn from knowledge or scheming,
no comprehension of what comes before or after,
he merely rested where he was, and that was all.

推而後行
Pushed, he would finally begin to move;
曳而後往
dragged, he would at last start on his way.

若飄風之還
若羽之旋
若磨石之隧
全而無非
He revolved like a whirlwind,
spun like a feather,
went round and round like a grindstone,
keeping himself whole and free from condemnation.

動靜無過
未嘗有罪
Without error, whether in motion or at rest,
never once was he guilty of any fault.

是何故
Why was this?

夫無知之物
無建己之患
無用知之累
Because a creature that is without knowledge
does not face the perils that come from trying to set oneself up,
the entanglements that come from relying on knowledge.

動靜不離於理
In motion or in stillness, he never departs from reason---
是以終身無譽
in this way he lives out his years without winning praise.

故曰
至於若無知之物而已
Therefore Shen Dao said,
"Let me become like those creatures without knowledge,
that is enough.[^33-17]

無用賢聖
Such creatures have no use for the worthies or the sages.

夫塊不失道
Clod-like, they never lose the Way."

豪桀相與笑之
曰慎到之道非生人之行而至死人之理
The great and eminent men would get together and laugh at him,
saying, "The teachings of Shen Dao are not rules for the living
but ideals for a dead man.

適得怪焉
No wonder he is looked on as peculiar!"

***

田駢亦然
Tian Pian was a similar case.

學於彭蒙得不教焉
He studied under Peng Meng
and learned what it means not to compare things.

彭蒙之師曰
古之道人至於莫之是莫之非
Peng Meng's teacher used to say,
"In ancient times the men of the Way reached the point
where they regarded nothing as right and nothing as wrong---
而已矣
that was all."

其風窢然
But such ways are mute and muffled---
惡可而言
how can they be captured in words?

常反人不見觀
Peng Meng and Tian Pian always went contrary to other men
and were seldom heeded.

而不免於鯇斷
They could not seem to avoid lopping away at the corners.

其所謂道非道而所言之韙不免於非
What they called the Way was not the true Way,
and when they said a thing was right,
they could not avoid raising the possibility that it might be wrong.[^33-18]

彭蒙田駢慎到不知道
雖然概乎皆嘗有聞者也
Peng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shen Dao
did not really understand the Way,
though all had at one time heard something of what it was like.

---

以本為精
以物為粗
以有積為不足
To regard the source as pure
and the things that emerge from it as coarse,
to look on accumulation as insufficiency;
澹然獨與神明居
古之道術有在於是者
dwelling alone, peaceful and placid, in spiritual brightness
there were those in ancient times who believed
that the "art of the Way" lay in these things.

關尹老聃聞其風而悅之
The Barrier Keeper Yin and Lao Dan heard of their views
and delighted in them.[^33-19]

建之以常無有主之以太一
They expounded them in terms of constant non-being and being
and headed their doctrine with the concept of the Great Unity.

以濡弱謙下為表
Gentle weakness and humble self-effacement
are its outer marks;
以空虛不毀萬物為實
emptiness, void, and the noninjury of the ten thousand things
are its essence.

***

關尹曰
在己無居形物自著
The Barrier Keeper Yin said,
"When a man does not dwell in self,
then things will of themselves reveal their forms to him.

其動若水
其靜若鏡
其應若響
His movement is like that of water,
his stillness like that of a mirror,
his responses like those of an echo.

芴乎若亡
Blank eyed, he seems to be lost;
寂乎若清
motionless, he has the limpidity of water.

同焉者和
Because he is one with it, he achieves harmony;
得焉者失
should he reach out for it, he would lose it.

未嘗先人而常隨人
Never does he go ahead of other men,
but always follows in their wake."

***

老聃曰
知其雄守其雌
Lao Dan said,
"Know the male but cling to the female;
為天下谿
become the ravine of the world.

知其白守其辱
Know the pure but cling to dishonor;
為天下谷
become the valley of the world." [^33-20]

人皆取先
Others all grasp what is in front;
己獨取後
he alone grasped what is behind.

曰受天下之垢
He said, "Take to yourself the filth of the world."

人皆取實
Others all grasp what is full;
己獨取虛
he alone grasped what is empty.

無藏也
He never stored away---
故有餘
therefore he had more than enough;
巋然而有餘
he had heaps and heaps of more than enough!

其行身也徐而不費
In his movement, he was easygoing and did not wear himself out.

無為也而笑巧
Dwelling in inaction, he scoffed at skill.

人皆求福
Others all seek good fortune;
己獨曲全
he alone kept himself whole by becoming twisted.

曰苟免於咎
He said, "Let us somehow or other avoid incurring blame!"

以深為根
以約為紀
He took profundity to be the root
and frugality to be the guideline.

曰堅則毀矣
銳則拙矣
He said, "What is brittle will be broken,
what is sharp will be blunted."

常寬容於物
不削於人
He was always generous and permissive with things
and inflicted no pain on others---
可謂至極
this may be called the highest achievement.

***

關尹老聃乎
The Barrier Keeper Yin and Lao Dan---
古之博大真人哉
with their breadth and stature,
they indeed were the True Men of old!

---

芴漠無形
Blank, boundless, and without form;
變化無常
transforming, changing, never constant.

死與
Are we dead?

生與
Are we alive?

天地並與
Do we stand side by side with Heaven and earth?

神明往與
Do we move in the company of spiritual brightness?

芒乎何之
Absentminded, where are we going?

忽乎何適
Forgetful, where are we headed for?

萬物畢羅
The ten thousand things ranged all around us;
莫足以歸
not one of them is worthya to be singled out as our destination---
古之道術有在於是者
there were those in ancient times who believed
that the "art of the Way" lay in these things.

莊周聞其風而悅之
Zhuang Zhou heard of their views
and delighted in them.

以謬悠之說
荒唐之言
無端崖之辭
時恣縱而不儻不以觭見之也
He expounded them in odd and outlandish terms,
in brash and bombastic language,
in unbound and unbordered phrases,
abandoning himself to the times without partisanship,
not looking at things from one angle only.

以天下為沈濁不可與莊語
He believed that the world was drowned in turbidness
and that it was impossible to address it in sober language.

以卮言為曼衍
以重言為真
以寓言為廣
So he used "goblet words" to pour out endless changes,
"repeated words" to give a ring of truth,
and "imputed words" to impart greater breadth.

獨與天地精神往來而不敖倪於萬物
He came and went alone with the pure spirit of Heaven and earth,
yet he did not view the ten thousand things with arrogant eyes.

不譴是非以與世俗處
He did not scold over "right" and "wrong"
but lived with the age and its vulgarity.

其書雖瑰瑋而連犿無傷也
Though his writings are a string of queer beads and baubles,
they roll and rattle and do no one any harm.[^33-21]

其辭雖參差而諔詭可觀
彼其充實不可以已
Though his words seem to be at sixes and sevens,
yet among the sham and waggery, there are things worth observing,
for they are crammed with truths that never come to an end.

***

上與造物者遊而下與外死生無終始者為友
Above he wandered with the Creator,
below he made friends with
those who have gotten outside life and death,
who know nothing of beginning or end.

其於本也宏大而辟
As for the Source,
his grasp of it was broad, expansive, and penetrating;
深閎而肆
profound, liberal, and unimpeded.

其於宗也可謂稠適而上遂矣
As for the Ancestor,
he may be said to have tuned and accommodated himself to it
and to have risen on it to the greatest heights.

雖然其應於化而解於物也
其理不竭
其來不蛻
Nevertheless, in responding to change
and expounding on the world of things,
he set forth principles that will never cease to be valid,
an approach that can never be shuffled off.

芒乎昧乎未之盡者
Veiled and arcane,
he is one who has never been completely comprehended.

惠施多方其書五車
Hui Shi was a man of many devices,
and his writings would fill five carriages.

其道舛駁
其言也不中
But his doctrines were jumbled and perverse,
and his words wide of the mark.

歷物之意曰
His way of dealing with things may be seen from these sayings:

***

辯者以此與惠施相應終身無窮
Such were the sayings
that the rhetoricians used in answer to Hui Shi,
rambling on without stop till the end of their days.

桓團公孫龍辯者之徒
Huan Duan and Gongsun Long were among such rhetoricians.[^33-29]

飾人之心
易人之意
能勝人之口
不能服人之心
Dazzling men's minds,
unsettling their views,
they could outdo others in talking
but could not make them submit in their minds---
辯者之囿也
such were the limitations of the rhetoricians.

***

惠施日以其知與人之辯
特與天下之辯者為怪
Hui Shi, day after day, used all the knowledge he had
in his debates with others,
deliberately thinking up ways
to astonish the rhetoricians of the world---
此其柢也
the preceding examples illustrate this.

然惠施之口談自以為最賢
Nevertheless, Hui Shi's manner of speaking
showed that he considered himself the ablest man alive.

曰天地
"Heaven and earth---
其壯乎
perhaps they are greater!" he used to declare.

施存雄
All he knew how to do was play the hero;
而無術
he had no real art.

***

南方有倚人焉曰黃繚問
天地所以不墜不陷
風雨雷霆之故
In the south there was an eccentric named Huang Liao who asked
why Heaven and earth do not collapse and crumble
or what makes the wind and rain, the thunder and lightning.

惠施不辭而應
Hui Shi, undaunted, undertook to answer him;
不慮而對遍為萬物說
說而不休
多而無已
without stopping to think, he began to reply,
touching on every one of the ten thousand things in his peroration,
expounding on and on without stop
in multitudes of words that never ended.

猶以為寡益之以怪
But still it was not enough,
and so he began to add on his astonishing assertions.

以反人為實而欲以勝人為名
Whatever contradicted other men's views
he declared to be the truth,
hoping to win a reputation for outwitting others.

是以與眾不適也
This was why he never got along with ordinary people.

弱於德
強於物
其塗隩矣
Weak in inner virtue,
strong in his concern for external things,
he walked a road that was crooked indeed!

由天地之道
觀惠施之能
其猶一蚉一虻之勞者也
If we examine Hui Shi's accomplishments
from the point of view of the Way of Heaven and earth,
they seem like the exertions of a mosquito or a gnat---
其於物也何庸
of what use are they to other things?

夫充一尚可曰愈貴道幾矣
True, he still deserves to be regarded as the founder of one school,
though I say, if he had only shown greater respect for the Way,
he would have come nearer to being right.

惠施不能以此自寧
Hui Shi, however, could not seem to find
any tranquillity for himself in such an approach.

散於萬物而不厭
卒以善辯為名
Instead, he went on tirelessly
separating and analyzing the ten thousand things
and, in the end, was known only for his skill in exposition.

惜乎
What a pity---
惠施之才駘蕩而不得
that Hui Shi abused and dissipated his talents
without ever really achieving anything!

逐萬物而不反
是窮響以聲形與影競走也
Chasing after the ten thousand things, never turning back,
he was like one who tries to shout an echo into silence
or to prove that form can outrun shadow.
悲夫
How sad!
