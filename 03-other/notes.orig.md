[^24-1]: It is proud and self-confident.

[^24-2]: Probably works on military affairs,
though their identity is uncertain.

[^24-3]: The meaning is doubtful.
As Fukunaga points out, the sentence seems to be related to _Daodejing_ LXXI.

[^24-4]: I follow Fukunaga in taking *bian* as a loan for the *bian* that means argument or debate.

[^24-5]: Great Clod (I take *wei* as standing for *kuai*) here represents the way.
The names of the Yellow Emperor's attendants probably have some allegorical significance as well,
but their exact meaning is uncertain,
and it seems best not to attempt to translate them.

[^24-6]: I follow Ma Xulun in reading *er* in place of *bu*.

[^24-7]: The philosophers Mo Di and Yang Zhu appeared on p.
61.
Bing is the polite name of the logician Gongsun Long (see p.
135);
some scholars take the fourth philosopher to be Song Keng (see p.
291).

[^24-8]: Winter is dominated by yin,
the element of cold and water;
summer by yang,
the element of heat and fire.
But to produce fire,
the disciple must have utilized some source of heat,
and to produce ice,
some source of cold;
hence he was merely "using the yang to attract the yang," etc.

[^24-9]: The point of the story seems to be that although Lu Ju made fun of his disciple for "simply using the yang to attract the yang," his own stunts were confined to the same level;
that is,
he used sounds to produce sounds.
In the same way,
the various philosophers debate back and forth,
but none ever succeeds in going beyond the level of the relative.

[^24-10]: It was the custom to employ condemned criminals who had had their feet cut off or maimed as gatekeepers,
though not,
as in this case,
deliberately to maim men for that purpose.

[^24-11]: This last paragraph is all but unintelligible as it stands.
For the most part,
I follow Fukunaga's emendations and interpretations.
Zhuangzi is warning Huizi that his debates with the other philosophers may actually put him in peril.

[^24-12]: On Guan Zhong and Duke Huan,
see p.
150.

[^24-13]: Following the version in *Liezi*,
sec.
6,
I supply a *bu* before the second verb.
There are many versions of this anecdote found in early philosophical texts,
and this sentence appears in different form in each.

[^24-14]: Presumably the same as Ziqi of South Wall;
see p.
7.

[^24-15]: Tian He was a high minister of Qi who became its virtual ruler;
see p.
69.
The people congratulated him because he recognized and paid honor to the sage recluse Ziqi.

[^24-16]: I follow Xi Tong in taking *xian* as an error for *you*.
Ziqi means that by becoming a recluse,
he was deliberately courting notoriety and hence was no better than any other seeker of fame.

[^24-17]: In 479 BCE,
the year of Confucius's death,
a nobleman of one branch of the royal family of Chu led an uprising.
He tried to enlist the support of Xiong Yiliao from south of the Market (see sec.
20,
p.
157),
first attempting to persuade him,
then threatening him at the point of a sword,
but Yiliao steadfastly refused.
Partly as a result,
the revolt quickly failed,
and peace was restored among the various branches of the royal family.
The juggling of the balls presumably symbolized unconcern in the face of danger.
Sunshu Ao,
a high minister of Chu who lived a generation before Confucius,
governed so effectively that he was able to rest in ease,
and the people of the Chu capital,
Ying,
with no fear of foreign invasion,
could lay away their arms;
see p.
174.
Both men appear here as examples of the superiority of silence over talk.
The "beak three feet long" apparently represents the "speech that is not spoken," that is,
the state of enlightenment;
compare sec.
12,
p.
89: "You may join in the cheeping and chirping,
and when you have joined in the cheeping and chirping,
you may join with Heaven and earth."

[^24-18]: Following texts that read *zhou* instead of *tong*.

[^24-19]: As we have seen earlier,
men whose feet were maimed were employed as gatekeepers because they couldn't run away.

[^24-20]: Following Sun Yirang's emendations.

[^24-21]: Compare sec.
23,
p.
190.

[^24-22]: Reading *xiong* in place of *qin*.

[^24-23]: The ants and mutton (the text says "sheep," but presumably the word "meat" has dropped out) appeared earlier;
on the fishes who "forget one another in the rivers and lakes," see sec.
6,
p.
50.

[^24-24]: As there are times when now one medicine,
now another,
will be appropriate,
so there are times when life is appropriate,
times when death is.
The remainder of the chapter is rather disconnected in thought,
and it is often difficult to make out the author's intent.

[^24-25]: Goujian,
king of Yue,
was defeated by the troops of Wu (see p.
5) and forced to flee with a band of followers to the top of Mount Kuaiji.
There he plotted revenge with Zhong and another trusted minister.
But later,
when he had successfully turned the tables and defeated Wu,
he grew suspicious of Zhong and forced him to commit suicide.

[^24-26]: The Way.

[^24-27]: The Way.

[^25-1]: Zeyang or Peng Yang (the name appears both ways in the passage) is vaguely identified as a native of Lu.
In hopes of official appointment,
he is obviously seeking an introduction to the king of Chu through various courtiers.

[^25-2]: I fail to see how this saying,
if I understand it correctly,
is meant to apply to the context.

[^25-3]: The latter part of the sentence is unintelligible in the original,
and the translation is no more than a guess.

[^25-4]: I follow Ma Xulun in the interpretation of *qi*;
the sentence is vague,
and there are many other interpretations.

[^25-5]: Any number of different translations could be made of this haunting and troublesome paragraph,
all as tentative as the one I offer here.
It has traditionally been interpreted to express the joy a person experiences when he returns to his inborn nature.

[^25-6]: Compare sec.
2,
p.
10: "When the hinge is fitted into the socket,
it can respond endlessly." Mr.
Renxiang is vaguely identified as an ancient sage ruler.

[^25-7]: I take *qi* as in the earlier passage;
see n.
4.

[^25-8]: Compare sec.
2,
p.
11: "This is called walking two roads." It would seem that Tang turned over the actual affairs of government to Deng Heng and retained only the title of ruler for himself.
But this whole passage is barely intelligible,
and there are many interpretations.

[^25-9]: There is some doubt about the names and identity of these noblemen.

[^25-10]: Men who develop ulcers on their back as a result of intense anger and frustration are mentioned in other early Chinese texts.

[^25-11]: The commander of the Qi army.

[^25-12]: Following Yu Yue,
I read *qi* in place of *shi*.

[^25-13]: I borrow these translations of the names with gratitude from Waley (_Three Ways of Thought_,
p.
64).

[^25-14]: The text says only that they had climbed to the roof (if that is,
in fact,
the meaning of *dengji*).
Commentators disagree as to why they were there,
but it seems most natural to suppose that they had gathered to gawk at Confucius,
the pseudo sage,
unaware that they were actually in the employ of a real sage.

[^25-15]: See sec.
20,
p.
157,
and sec.
24,
p.
208.

[^25-16]: A disciple of Confucius.

[^25-17]: Bodies of executed criminals were exposed in the marketplace.

[^25-18]: Following Yu Yue,
I read *guo* in place of *yu*,
but perhaps the phrase should be further emended.

[^25-19]: Compare sec.
2,
p.
17,
"If so were really so," etc.

[^25-20]: Ling was the posthumous title bestowed on him by the court historiographers,
whose duty it was to choose a title that was appropriate to the life and moral qualities of the deceased ruler.
Ling may have either good or bad connotations,
depending on how one interprets it.
In what follows,
it is apparent that Confucius is taking it in a good sense,
Da Tao in a bad one,
and Bo Changqian in both senses.

[^25-21]: This is Fukunaga's guess as to what this impenetrable sentence means;
he emends *suo* to *er*.

[^25-22]: Following texts that read *mai* in place of *li*.

[^25-23]: That is,
"community words" are general terms or concepts that subsume a number of differing particulars.
This section in parts resembles the discussion of semantics in sec.
17,
pp.
129-131,
and in _Xunzi_,
sec.
22.

[^25-24]: *Gong*,
"common," "public," "generally accepted";
translated earlier as "impartial" in order to bring out the contract with "partiality."

[^25-25]: Compare the similar passage in sec.
14,
p.
114.

[^25-26]: Following Ma Xulun's emendation.
The word "breath" refers to the prevailing wind,
temperature,
and other weather phenomena associated with each season.

[^25-27]: This sentence does not fit into the parallelism and is probably defective.

[^25-28]: That is,
can become one with the nameless Way.

[^25-29]: That is,
whatever name we agree to use in designating the Way,
we must not suppose that it can in any sense adequately describe or convey an idea of the Way itself.

[^25-30]: Following Wang Yun's interpretation.

[^25-31]: Ji Zhen and Jiezi are philosophers of whom little is known.
As we see here,
the latter taught the existence of some prime mover or governor of the universe,
while the former denied it.

[^25-32]: Are these two sentences meant to express a contrast between the relativistic and the absolute viewpoints,
or to be two statements of the relativistic viewpoint?

I am unable to decide.

[^26-1]: Guan Longfeng,
minister to the tyrant Jie,
and Prince Bi Gan,
minister to the tyrant Zhou,
appeared on p.
23.
Prince Ji was a relative of Zhou who had to feign madness in order to escape execution.
E Lai assisted Zhou and was put to death when Zhou was overthrown.

[^26-2]: Wu Yun,
or Wu Zixu,
the loyal minister of Wu,
appeared on p.
140.
He was forced by the king to commit suicide,
and his body was thrown into the Yangzi.
Chang Hong is mentioned in the _Zuozhuan_ as a minister of the Zhou court who was killed in 492 BCE.
But if this is the same man,
the story of his exile and suicide in Shu and the miraculous transformation of his blood must come from later legend.

[^26-3]: Xiaoji was the eminently filial son of King Wuding of the Shang;
he was said to have been persecuted by an evil stepmother.
Zeng Shen,
a disciple of Confucius and likewise a paragon of filial piety,
was despised by his father.

[^26-4]: This paragraph presents numerous difficulties of interpretation,
and the translation is tentative at many points.
In places the language appears to be that of ancient Chinese medicine,
with its theories of the influences of the yin and yang acting within the body.
Thus the moon may represent the watery force of the yin,
or perhaps the cold light of the mind.

[^26-5]: The pearl or other precious stone customarily placed in the mouth of the corpse at burial.

[^26-6]: A Daoist sage and reputed author of a work in sixteen sections that is no longer extant.
He is sometimes identified with Laozi.

[^26-7]: Following texts that read *wu* in place of *ao*.

[^26-8]: The meaning is very doubtful.

[^26-9]: This last speech of Lao Laizi presents numerous difficulties,
and the translation is tentative.

[^26-10]: Small indentations were drilled in the carapace,
and heat was applied: divination was based on the shape of the cracks that resulted.

[^26-11]: See p.
136,
n.
17.

[^26-12]: Xiwei,
identified as a mythical ruler of high antiquity,
appeared on p.
45,
as the sage who "held up heaven and earth." The Confucians and Mohists are the most notorious extollers of antiquity,
but the same tendency is discernible at times in the Daoist school,
for example,
in Laozi's description of the ideal simplicity and primitiveness of the society of very ancient times.
I suspect that "the fashion of Xiwei" is a reference to these advocates of ancient simplicity in the Daoist school,
though our understanding of the passage is greatly hampered by the fact that we know almost nothing about the Xiwei legend.
As this passage makes clear,
Zhuangzi's ideal "wandering"---that is,
living in accordance with the Way---does not permit either a forced conformity with the world or a forced withdrawal from,
and denial of,
the world.

[^26-13]: The second part of the sentence is obscure in the original.

[^26-14]: I take fame,
show,
schemes,
wisdom,
and the arranging of government affairs for the convenience of the mob to be "unnatural" and undesirable aims and activities that interfere with man's growth.

[^26-15]: This whole paragraph,
and especially the last sentence,
is very difficult to interpret,
and there is no agreement among commentators as to the exact meaning.

[^26-16]: Xu You,
the recluse who refused Yao's throne,
appeared on p.
3.
A similar story is told about King Tang and the recluse Wu Guang.
Ji Tuo and Shentu Di,
along with Wu Guang,
were mentioned on p.
43,
but we know nothing of their stories.
Apparently they withdrew or committed suicide out of sympathy for the insult that had been done to Wu Guang in offering him a throne.

[^27-1]: See p.
17.
The passage that follows describes three literary devises used in the _Zhuangzi_ as a whole: (1) *yuyan*,
"imputed words," words put into the mouth of historical or fictional persons to make them more compelling;
(2) *chongyan*,
"repeated words" (another interpretation would make it *zhongyan* or "weighty words"),
words of the wise old men of the past that are "repeated" or quoted to give authority to the argument;
and (3) *zhiyan*,
"goblet words," words that are like a goblet that tips when full and rights itself when empty,
that is,
that adapt to and follow along with the fluctuating nature of the world and thus achieve a state of harmony.

[^27-2]: Compare sec.
2,
p.
12,
but it seems odd that the two clauses should repeat the same idea.

[^27-3]: Compare sec.
2,
p.
10.

[^27-4]: The same remark was made on p.
222 in reference to Qu Boyu.

[^27-5]: Following Zhang Binglin's interpretation.

[^27-6]: Zeng Shen,
the paragon of filial piety,
appeared earlier;
see esp.
sec.
26,
p.
227.

[^27-7]: Literally,
"what lives in the yang";
compare sec.
2,
p.
8.
"And when their minds draw near to death,
nothing can restore them to the light."

[^27-8]: Following Zhang Binglin's interpretation.

[^27-9]: The term "Powerful Yang" appeared in sec.
22,
p.
180;
the yang is the element of fire and hence is the essence of the firelight and sunlight mentioned earlier.
This whole section is a reworking of the passage in sec.
2,
p.
18.

[^27-10]: According to another interpretation,
these four adjectives are descriptions of good qualities,
that is,
of what Laozi wants Yang to become.
Fukunaga takes them as synonymous with those in sec.
7,
p.
55,
translated as "peaceful and easy,
wide-eyed,
and blank."

[^27-11]: Almost identical with a passage in _Daodejing_ XLI.

[^27-12]: Because he has ceased to look and act like a man of any importance,
that is,
had become a true follower of the Way.

[^28-1]: On Yao,
Xu You,
and the ceding of the throne,
see p.
3.
In this chapter,
the writer illustrates the theme with tales of various historical or legendary figures.

[^28-2]: Danfu,
ancestor of the royal house of Zhou,
was the grandfather of King Wen,
the founder of the Zhou dynasty.

[^28-3]: That is,
the lives of his people are far more precious to the ruler than the possession of his territory.
This moral and the story of Danfu that illustrates it are famous in early Chinese literature and are found in numerous texts of the period.

[^28-4]: King Zhao was forced by the invading armies of Wu to flee his state in 506 BCE;
he returned the following year.

[^28-5]: Some versions of the text call them the "three scepter" offices;
they are defined by commentators as the three highest ministerial posts in the state of Chu.

[^28-6]: Yuan Xian,
a disciple of Confucius,
was famous for his indifference to poverty.
Zigong,
who figures in this anecdote,
was the most affluent of Confucius's disciples.

[^28-7]: Zeng Shen;
see p.
227.

[^28-8]: About enough land to feed four people;
cf.
_Mencius_ IA,
24.

[^28-9]: Prince Mou of Wei appeared on p.
135.
Apparently he was trying,
without much success,
to live the life of a hermit.
Zhanzi,
or Zhan He,
is mentioned in early texts as a Daoist adept.

[^28-10]: The passage that follows involves a great deal of wordplay on the various meanings of *qiong* (to be blocked,
hence,
to be in trouble,
in distress,
etc.) and *da* (to get through,
hence to master,
to succeed).

[^28-11]: A paraphrase of Confucius's remarks in _Analects_ IX,
27: "Only when the year grows cold do we see that the pine and cypress are the last to fade."

[^28-12]: Reading *de* (get) in place of *de* (virtue);
compare the parallel text in _Lüshi chunchiu_,
ch.
14,
sec.
6.

[^28-13]: Gong Bo was said to have occupied the throne for fourteen years (842-828 BCE) but abdicated and retired to a place called Mount Gong.

[^28-14]: Tang attacked and overthrew his sovereign,
Jie,
the last ruler of the Xia dynasty,
and founded the Shang or Yin dynasty.

[^28-15]: Dan is better known by his title,
the Duke of Zhou.
Other versions of the story make it clear that the "man who seems to possess the Way," whose reputation had attracted the brothers,
was King Wu's father,
King Wen,
who was already dead by this time.

[^28-16]: According to ancient custom,
an animal was sacrificed,
and the parties to the pact smeared the corners of their mouths with its blood;
then the text of the agreement was also smeared with blood and was buried beneath the sacrificial altar.

[^28-17]: Following Wang Niansun's suggestions,
I omit the word *xia*.

[^28-18]: That is,
King Wu,
by resorting to arms and overthrowing the Yin dynasty,
has shown himself far inferior to his father,
King Wen,
or his great grandfather,
the Great King Danfu of the anecdote on p.
240.
But some commentators would emend this to read "the virtue of the Yin."

[^30-1]: The title may also be interpreted to mean "Delighting in Swords." Why both meanings are appropriate will become apparent.

[^30-2]: The sentence is deliberately cryptic and capable of interpretation on a variety of levels.

[^30-3]: These all are feudal states or strategic places of northern China surrounding the state of Zhao.

[^30-4]: The stars collectively make up the third luminous body.

[^30-5]: The state of Zhao,
situated in north central China,
was never very powerful,
and its king,
only one among many feudal rulers of the time,
in no sense occupied anything that could be called "the position of a Son of Heaven." If the writer has not abandoned all pretense at historicity,
he must mean that if the king of Zhao were to rule wisely,
he might in time gain sufficient power and prestige to become a contender for the position of Son of Heaven.

[^32-1]: Following Sun Yirang's emendation.

[^32-2]: Supplying a negative from the parallel passage in _Liezi_, sec. 2.

[^32-3]: Chinese at this time sat on mats on the floor;
consequently they removed their shoes before stepping up into a house.

[^32-4]: That is, good advice.

[^32-5]: Is the fact that he has changed into berries
an indication of unappeased anger that will not let him rest in his grave,
or has it some other significance? I do not know.

[^32-6]: The story to which this refers is unknown.

[^32-7]: Meaning very doubtful.

[^32-8]: An upset in the balance of the yin and yang within the body
will bring on a consuming sickness;
see p. 26, n. 9.

[^32-9]: Zheng Kaofu, "The Upright Ancestor,"
was a forebear of Confucius who served
at the court of Song in the eighth century BCE.
The three appointments represent three advancements in court rank.
According to _Zhuozhuan_, _Zhao_ seventh year,
the passage describing him here
was part of the inscription on a bronze vessel used in his mortuary temple.

[^32-10]: The writer nowhere states what the other four types are.

[^32-11]: Following Xi Tong, I read *xing* to mean "punishment."

[^32-12]: The end of this sentence has dropped out of most texts.

[^32-13]: There would seem to be a play
on the various meanings of *ming*---"appointment," "fate," "command," etc.;
see p. 28, n. 12.
Some commentators take it to mean "life span."
