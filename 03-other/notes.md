[^23-1]: That is, faced in Laozi's direction.
He is displeased, of course,
because his worth has been discovered,
whereas the true sage remains hidden and unrecognized.

[^23-2]: For the sake of the parallelism,
I follow Ma Xulun's suggestion in adding the character *lou*.

[^23-3]: Following Ma Xulun's interpretation.

[^23-4]: The whole passage, as Fukunaga points out,
seems to be related to the remark in sec. 1, p. 4:
"And blindness and deadness
are not confined to the body alone---the understanding has them,
too, as your words just now have shown."

[^23-5]: According to Chinese nature lore,
the mud dauber can transform mulberry caterpillars into its own young.

[^23-6]: Laozi is referring perhaps to himself or to Gengsang Chu.
I follow Fukunaga in the interpretation of this paragraph.

[^23-7]: Almost identical with a passage in _Daodejing_ LV.
Parts of this paragraph are in rhyme.

[^23-8]: This sentence has dropped out of most versions of the text.

[^23-9]: Compare sec. 2, p. 14:
"Therefore understanding that rests in what it does not understand
is the finest.
Who can understand discriminations that are not spoken,
the Way that is not a way?"

[^23-10]: "Spirit Tower," like "Spirit Storehouse,"
is a Daoist term for the mind;
see the parallel passage in sec. 5, p. 39.

[^23-11]: The thought and wording of this paragraph,
particularly the key term "sincerity,"
are closely allied to the *Zhongyong* or "The Mean,"
a chapter of the _Book of Rites_
that later became one of the most important texts in Confucian thought.

[^23-12]: I follow Yu Yue in the interpretation of the word *chi*.

[^23-13]: Moye, the famous sword of antiquity,
was mentioned in sec. 6, p. 48.

[^23-14]: That is, the workings of the mind or will
upset the balance of the yin and yang within the body
and automatically bring on illness;
see sec. 4, p. 26, n. 9.

[^23-15]: Compare sec. 2, p. 11:
"The Way makes them all into one.
Their dividedness is their completeness;
their completeness is their impairment."
I follow Fukunaga in supplying the characters *chengye*,
which are found in the Kōzanji text of the _Zhuangzi_,
thus making the passage identical with that in sec. 2 just cited.

[^23-16]: Compare sec. 2, p. 8:
The "True Master...can act---that is certain.
Yet I cannot see his form.
He has identity but no form."

[^23-17]: The paragraph up to this point
is identical with the passage in sec. 2, pp. 11-12.

[^23-18]: Following Wang Niansun, I read *dao* in place of *shou*;
see sec. 22, p. 185,
n.

[^23-19]: I follow Zhang Binglin in the interpretation of *dai*,
and Ma Xulun in emending the name Jia to Qu.
The Zhao, Jing, and Qu families all were branches
of the ruling family of the state of Chu.
Zhao and Jing were the posthumous names
of the rulers from whom the families descended:
Qu was originally the name of the area where the Qu family was enfeoffed.

[^23-20]: That is, because analysis is possible.
This paragraph is a mass of textual problems and uncertainties,
and only the most tentative translation can be offered.
The point seems to be that
although it is possible to analyze things
such as an ox or a house into their component parts,
nothing is gained by the process.

[^23-21]: Following the texts that omit the *fei*.

[^23-22]: On the cicada and the little dove, see sec. 1, p. 1-2.

[^23-23]: With seals, tallies, and other pledges of good faith.

[^23-24]: That is,
though he "abides by Heaven"---that is,
acts with complete naturalness and spontaneity---he deplores
any conscious attempt to analyze or understand this naturalness,
which is the Way.

[^23-25]: Tang, founder of the Shang dynasty,
recognized the worth of Yi Yin
when the latter was serving as one of his cooks.
Boli Xi, another worthy,
was ransomed from captivity by Duke Mu of Qin
for the price of five ram skins.
On the latter, see sec. 21, p. 172, n. 10.

[^23-26]: I follow Ma Xulun's emendation.

[^29-1]: Following the emendation suggested by Sun Yirang.

[^29-2]: Following the emendation suggested by Yu Yue.

[^29-3]: A phrase of utmost politeness;
Confucius would not venture to come close
or look up at the face of his host
but only gaze at his feet where they show beneath the curtain of state.

[^29-4]: That is, become a ruler.
The Chinese ruler faces south and refers to himself as the "Lonely One,"
either because of the uniqueness of his position or,
if he has inherited the throne, because his father is dead.

[^29-5]: Chi You is a legendary being,
often described as part man and part animal,
who is associated in Chinese mythology
with warfare and the invention of weapons.

[^29-6]: According to legend, Zilu, before he met Confucius,
was a brash warrior noted for his courage.
In the revolt in Wei, which took place in 480 BCE,
he seems to have fought and died
out of a sense of loyalty to the man whose retainer he was;
see _Zuozhuan_, Duke Ai, fifteenth year.

[^29-7]: Yao killed his eldest son;
Shun banished his mother's younger brother;
and Yu worked so hard trying to control the flood
that he became paralyzed on one side.
Confucian writers on the whole
recognize the various assertions here made as historical fact
but offer justifications for them all.

[^29-8]: Reading "seven" instead of "six."
Some commentators would retain the "six"
and delete King Wen's name from the list.

[^29-9]: Bao Jiao is said to have been
a recluse who refused to acknowledge allegiance to any sovereign
but lived in the forest and ate acorns.
When someone pointed out that even this constituted
a utilization of the land resources of the ruler,
he committed suicide in the bizarre fashion mentioned here.
Shentu Di has already appeared on pp. 43 and 233.
Jie Zitui, retainer to Prince Chonger of Jin,
faithfully served the prince during nineteen years of exile,
saving him from starvation in the manner described.
But when the prince returned to Jin in 636 BCE and became its ruler,
he forgot to reward Jie Zitui.
Angered, Jie withdrew to a forest;
when the ruler tried to smoke him out, he chose to die in the fire.

[^29-10]: On Prince Bi Gan, see p. 23, on Wu Zixu, see p. 140, n. 2.

[^29-11]: The point of departure for this colloquy,
as Legge pointed out, is probably the remark in _Analects_ II, 18,
that "Zizhang studies with a view to official emolument."
Man Goude is a fictitious name meaning "Full of Ill-Gotten Gains."

[^29-12]: That is, act naturally.

[^29-13]: On Duke Huan and Guan Zhong, see p. 150; on Tian Cheng, see p. 68.

[^29-14]: King Ji, a younger son of the Great King Danfu (see p. 240)
succeeded his father instead of his elder brother;
the usual explanation is that the elder brother,
realizing Ji's worth, deliberately withdrew and went into exile.
The Duke of Zhou (reluctantly, we are told),
executed his elder brother who was plotting revolt.

[^29-15]: The name Wu Yue means "without bonds";
his answer, like all the speeches in this anecdote,
is highly contrived and couched in rhymed and elaborately balanced phrases.

[^29-16]: Following Wang Niansun's interpretation.

[^29-17]: Some of these figures appeared earlier, esp. on p. 257.
Honest Gong of Chu informed the authorities when his father stole a sheep but,
instead of receiving praise, was sentenced to death for his unfilial conduct.
Shenzi is probably Shensheng, prince of Jin,
who refused to clear himself of the false charge
of trying to poison his father
because to do so would expose his father to ridicule.
Nothing definite is known about the charges against Confucius and Kuangzi,
though commentators speculate
that the meaning is that they were not present at the death of their parents.

[^31-1]: The word "altar" here refers to a mesa or flat-topped hill
rising out of the lowland.

[^31-2]: A jocular reference to Confucius's remark
that in any village of ten houses,
one might find a person as loyal and true to his word as he,
but none with such a great love of learning.
_Analects_ V, 27.

[^31-3]: Another possible interpretation would be,
"I will explain my own ways and try applying them to the things," etc.

[^31-4]: Chiming stones were shaped like an inverted "V."

[^33-1]: Judging from the terminology,
the "Sage" represents the Daoist ideal,
the "gentleman," the Confucian ideal,
and what follows,
the Legalist ideal of government by laws and bureaucratic control.
But perhaps the writer intends all these concepts of government
to represent different levels in the great,
eclectic concept of ideal government.

[^33-2]: These are the so-called Six Confucian Classics;
Zou and Lu were the native states of Mencius and Confucius, respectively.
It has been questioned whether there was ever an actual text called the _Music_,
or whether this refers to the body of traditional court music and dances
handed down by the Confucian scholars;
here, however, the wording seems to indicate a written text.
Descriptions such as this one of the nature of the Six Classics
are found in many texts of Han or possibly pre-Han date.
The description of the _Odes_,
essentially a pun on the words *shi* (poetry) and *zhi* (will or emotion),
could also be translated "the _Book of Odes_ describes feelings,"
an ambiguity that has led to much discussion among scholars of literary theory.

[^33-3]: These are the titles of two sections in the _Mozi_,
a text embodying the teaching of Master Mo Di;
Mozi's prescriptions concerning burial rites
are found in another section entitled "Moderation in Funerals."
In fairness, it should be noted that Mozi did not prohibit mourning outright
but thought it should be drastically simplified for reasons of economy.

[^33-4]: Following Yu Yue, I read *chuan* in place of *shan*.

[^33-5]: "Hard," "white," etc., were topics of logical debate
taken up by the Mohist school;
they seem to be essentially the same as the paradoxes
of the Logicians mentioned on pp. 297–298.

[^33-6]: _Han Feizi_, sec. 50,
mentions three rival factions of the Mohist school,
each of which claimed to represent the true teaching of Mo Di.
These sects were well-organized groups
under the strict control of an elder or grand master (Juzi),
who had the right to choose his successor from among the members of the group.

[^33-7]: Following Zhang Binglin, I read *ku* in place of *gou*.

[^33-8]: The name is also romanized as Song Xing;
in sec. 1, p. 3,
he is referred to as Song Rongzi and in other texts as Song Keng.
Little is known of him and Yin Wen beyond what is recorded here.

[^33-9]: Flat on top, like Mount Hua, hence symbolic of equality and peace.

[^33-10]: Compare sec. 1, p. 3:
"He drew a clear line between the internal
and the external and recognized the boundaries of true glory and disgrace."

[^33-11]: Or perhaps the meaning is "they discussed the phenomena of the mind."
Zhang Binglin would emend this to read "they discussed the desires of the mind."

[^33-12]: Little is known of Peng Meng and Tian Pian
beyond what is recorded here.
Shen Dao is often designated as a forerunner of the Legalist School;
only fragments of his writings remain.

[^33-13]: Following Xi Tong, I read *dao* in place of *shou*.

[^33-14]: It seems odd in view of what follows
that any imperfection should be imputed to the Way;
perhaps the text is faulty.

[^33-15]: Taking the *jiao* of the text
as equivalent to the *jiao* that means "to compare," that is,
to try to determine the relative value of things.

[^33-16]: No one has satisfactorily explained these two characters,
but on the basis of the parallel phrase in the next sentence,
it seems best to follow Ma Xulun in this interpretation.

[^33-17]: That is, the whirlwind, feather, and grindstone just mentioned.

[^33-18]: Compare sec. 2, p. 10: "Where there is recognition of right,
there must be recognition of wrong," etc.

[^33-19]: Guan Yin or the Barrier Keeper Yin appeared on p. 146.
A short work attributed to him is still extant
but is generally agreed to be spurious.
Legend says that when Laozi was leaving China,
he was asked by the Barrier Keeper Yin for some written exposition
of his teachings and produced the _Daodejing_ as a result,
though modern scholarship questions whether the name Guan Yin
in fact has anything to do with barriers.

[^33-20]: This first quotation tallies almost exactly
with parts of _Daodejing_ XXVIII.
The other sayings attributed here to Laozi
agree in thought and terminology with the _Daodejing_
but are not to be found in exactly this form in the present text of that work.

[^33-21]: The meaning is uncertain.

[^33-22]: This paradox was quoted on p. 9.
As will be seen,
most of these paradoxes deal with the relativity of space and time.
Since in most cases,
we do not know exactly how Hui Shi and the other logicians
quoted later explained their paradoxes,
it seems best not to try to comment at length on their meaning.

[^33-23]: Yan and Yue represented the northern and southern extremities,
respectively, of the China of this time.

[^33-24]: Two legs plus the concept of "leg";
compare sec. 2, p. 13.

[^33-25]: Ying was the capital of the state of Chu.

[^33-26]: "Hot" is no more than an arbitrary label that men use to describe
how they feel in the presence of fire.

[^33-27]: When one pronounces their names? There are other explanations.

[^33-28]: The word *zhi*, "pointing," was translated
on p. 10 as "attribute," that is, what can be pointed to.
The meaning here seems to be that the attributes of a thing,
that which we can point to, never fully describe the thing itself;
if they did, then it would be impossible to separate the thing
from its attributes.

[^33-29]: A work in three *zuan* attributed to the latter,
the _Gongsun Longzi_, is still extant.
See Max Perleberg, _The Works of Kung-sun Lung-tzu_ (Hong Kong, 1952).
