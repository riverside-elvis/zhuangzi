## 29 盜跖 Robber zhi

孔子與柳下季為友
柳下季之弟名曰盜跖
Confucius was a friend of Liuxia Ji,
who had a younger brother known as Robber Zhi.

盜跖從卒九千人
橫行天下
侵暴諸侯
穴室樞戶
驅人牛馬
取人婦女
Robber Zhi, with a band of nine thousand followers,
rampaged back and forth across the empire,
assaulting and terrorizing the feudal lords,
tunneling into houses, prying open doors,[^29-1]
herding off men's horses and cattle,
seizing their wives and daughters.

貪得忘親
不顧父母兄弟
不祭先祖
Greedy for gain, he forgot his kin,
gave not a look to father or mother, elder or younger brother,
and performed no sacrifices to his ancestors.

所過之邑
大國守城
Whenever he approached a city,
if it was that of a great state,
the inhabitants manned their walls;
小國入保
if that of a small state,
they fled into their strongholds.

萬民苦之
The ten thousand people all lived in dread of him.

***

孔子謂柳下季曰
夫為人父者必能詔其子
為人兄者必能教其弟
Confucius said to Liuxia Ji,
"One who is a father
must be able to lay down the law to his son,
and one who is an elder brother
must be able to teach his younger brother.

若父不能詔其子
兄不能教其弟
則無貴父子兄弟之親矣
If a father cannot lay down the law to his son
and an elder brother cannot teach his younger brother,
then the relationship between father and son
and elder and younger brother loses all value.

今先生世之才士也
弟為盜跖為天下害而弗能教也
Now here you are, sir,
one of the most talented gentlemen of the age,
and your younger brother is Robber Zhi, a menace to the world,
and you seem unable to teach him any better!

丘竊為先生羞之
If I may say so, I blush for you.

丘請為先生往說之
I would therefore like to go on your behalf
and try to persuade him to change his ways."

***

柳下季曰
先生言
為人父者必能詔其子
為人兄者必能教其弟
Liuxia Ji said,
"You have remarked, sir,
that a father must be able to lay down the law to his son,
and an elder brother must be able to teach his younger brother.

若子不聽父之詔
弟不受兄之教
雖今先生之辯將奈之何哉
But if the son will not listen
when his father lays down the law,
or if the younger brother refuses to heed
his elder brother's teachings,
then even with eloquence such as yours,
what is there to be done?

且跖之為人也
心如涌泉
意如飄風
強足以距敵
辯足以飾非
Moreover, Zhi is a man
with a mind like a jetting fountain,
a will like a blast of wind,
with strength enough to fend off any enemy,
and cunning enough to gloss over any evil.

順其心則喜
逆其心則怒
易辱人以言
If you go along with his way of thinking, he is delighted,
but if you go against him, he becomes furious,
and it is nothing to him to curse people in the vilest language.

先生必無往
You must not go near him!"

***

孔子不聽
顏回為御
子貢為右
往見盜跖
But Confucius paid no attention,
and with Yan Hui as his carriage driver,
and Zigong on his right,
he went off to visit Robber Zhi.

盜跖乃方休卒徒太山之陽膾人肝而餔之
Robber Zhi was just at that time
resting with his band of followers
on the sunny side of Mount Tai
and enjoying a late afternoon snack of minced human livers.

孔子下車而前見謁者
Confucius stepped down from the carriage and went forward
till he saw the officer in charge of receiving guests.

曰魯人孔丘聞將軍高義敬再拜謁者
"I am Kong Qiu, a native of Lu, and I have heard
that your general is a man of lofty principles," he said,
respectfully bowing twice to the officer.

謁者入通
The officer then entered and relayed the message.

盜跖聞之大怒
When Robber Zhi heard this, he flew into a great rage.

目如明星髮上指冠
His eyes blazed like shining stars,
and his hair stood on end and bristled beneath his cap.

曰此夫魯國之巧偽人孔丘非邪
"This must be none other than
that crafty hypocrite Kong Qiu from the state of Lu!

為我告之
Well, tell him this for me.

爾作言造語妄稱文武
You make up your stories, invent your phrases,
babbling absurd eulogies of Kings Wen and Wu.

冠枝木之冠
帶死牛之脅
多辭繆說
Topped with a cap like a branching tree,
wearing a girdle made from the ribs of a dead cow,
you pour out your flood of words, your fallacious theories.

不耕而食
不織而衣
You eat without ever plowing,
clothe yourself without ever weaving.

搖脣鼓舌
擅生是非
以迷天下之主
使天下學士不反其本
妄作孝弟而儌倖於封侯富貴者也
Wagging your lips, clacking your tongue,
you invent any kind of 'right' or 'wrong' that suits you,
leading astray the rulers of the world,
keeping the scholars of the world from returning to the Source,
capriciously setting up ideals of 'filial piety' and 'brotherliness,'
all the time hoping to worm your way into favor
with the lords of the fiefs or the rich and eminent!

子之罪大極重
Your crimes are huge, your offenses grave.[^29-2]

疾走歸不然
我將以子肝益晝餔之膳
You had better run home as fast as you can, because if you don't,
I will take your liver and add it to this afternoon's menu!"

***

孔子復通曰
丘得幸於季願望履幕下
Confucius sent in word again, saying,
"I have the good fortune to know your brother Ji,
and therefore I beg to be allowed to gaze from a distance
at your feet beneath the curtain."[^29-3]

***

謁者復通
盜跖曰
使來前
When the officer relayed this message,
Robber Zhi said,
"Let him come forward."

孔子趨而進避席反走再拜盜跖
Confucius came scurrying forward,
declined the mat that was set out for him,
stepped back a few paces,
and bowed twice to Robber Zhi.

盜跖大怒兩展其足案劍瞋目
Robber Zhi, still in a great rage,
sat with both legs sprawled out,
leaning on his sword, his eyes glaring.

聲如乳虎曰
丘來前
In a voice like the roar of a nursing tigress, he said,
"Qiu, come forward!

若所言
順吾意則生
If what you have to say
pleases my fancy, you live.

逆吾心則死
If it rubs me the wrong way, you die!"

***

孔子曰
丘聞之凡天下有三德
Confucius said,
"I have heard that in all the world
there are three kinds of virtue.

生而長大美好無雙
少長貴賤見而皆說之
To grow up to be big and tall, with matchless good looks,
so that everyone, young or old, eminent or humble, delights in you---
此上德也
this is the highest kind of virtue.

知維天地能辯諸物
To have wisdom that encompasses heaven and earth,
to be able to speak eloquently on all subjects---
此中德也
this is middling virtue.

勇悍果敢聚眾率兵
To be brave and fierce, resolute and determined,
gathering a band of followers around you---
此下德也
this is the lowest kind of virtue.

凡人有此一德者
足以南面稱孤矣
Any man who possesses even one of these virtues
is worthy to face south and call himself the Lonely One.[^29-4]

今將軍兼此三者
And now here you are, General, with all three of them!

身長八尺二寸
You tower eight feet two inches in height;
面目有光
radiance streams from your face and eyes;
脣如激丹
your lips are like gleaming cinnabar;
齒如齊貝
your teeth like ranged seashells;
音中黃鐘
your voice attuned to the *huang zhong* pitch pipe---
而名曰盜跖
and yet your only title is 'Robber Zhi.'

丘竊為將軍恥不取焉
If I may say so, General,
this is disgraceful---a real pity indeed!

將軍有意聽臣
臣請南使吳越北使齊魯
東使宋衛西使晉楚
使為將軍造大城數百里
立數十萬戶之邑
尊將軍為諸侯
But if you have a mind to listen to my proposal,
then I beg to be allowed to go as your envoy
south to Wu and Yue, north to Qi and Lu,
east to Song and Wei, and west to Jin and Chu,
persuading them to create for you
a great walled state several hundred *li* in size,
to establish a town of several hundred thousand households,
and to honor you as one of the feudal lords.

與天下更始
罷兵休卒
收養昆弟
共祭先祖
Then you may make a new beginning with the world,
lay down your weapons and disperse your followers,
gather together and cherish your brothers and kinsmen,
and join with them in sacrifices to your ancestors.

此聖人才士之行而天下之願也
This would be the act of a sage, a gentleman of true talent,
and the fondest wish of the world."

***

盜跖大怒曰
丘來前
Robber Zhi, furious as ever, said,
"Qiu, come forward!

夫可規以利而可諫以言者
皆愚陋恆民之謂耳
Those who can be swayed with offers of gain
or reformed by a babble of words
are mere idiots, simpletons, the commonest sort of men!

今長大美好人見而悅之者
The fact that I am big and tall and so handsome
that everyone delights to look at me---
此吾父母之遺德也
this is a virtue inherited from my father and mother.

丘雖不吾譽
吾獨不自知邪
Even without your praises,
do you think I would be unaware of it?

且吾聞之
好面譽人者亦好背而毀之
Moreover, I have heard that
those who are fond of praising men to their faces
are also fond of damning them behind their backs.

***

今丘告我以大城眾民
是欲規我以利而恆民畜我也
"Now you tell me about this great walled state,
this multitude of people,
trying to sway me with offers of gain,
to lead me by the nose like any common fool.

安可久長也
But how long do you think I could keep possession of it?

城之大者莫大乎天下矣
堯舜有天下子孫無置錐之地
There is no walled state larger than the empire itself,
and yet, though Yao and Shun possessed the empire,
their heirs were left with less land
than it takes to stick the point of an awl into.

湯武立為天子而後世絕滅
Tang and Wu set themselves up as Son of Heaven,
yet in ages after, their dynasties were cut off and wiped out.

非以其利大故邪
Was this not because the gains they had acquired were so great?

***

且吾聞之
古者禽獸多而人少
"Moreover, I have heard that
in ancient times the birds and beasts were many
and the people few.

於是民皆巢居以避之
晝拾橡栗暮栖木上
Therefore the people all
nested in the trees in order to escape danger,
during the day gathering acorns and chestnuts,
at sundown climbing back up to sleep in their trees.

故命之曰
有巢氏之民
Hence they were called
the people of the Nest Builder.

古者民不知衣服
In ancient times the people knew nothing about wearing clothes.

夏多積薪
In summer they heaped up great piles of firewood;
冬則煬之
in winter they burned them to keep warm.

故命之曰
知生之民
Hence they were called
'the people who know how to stay alive.'

神農之世
臥則居居
起則于于
In the age of Shennong,
the people lay down peaceful and easy,
woke up wide-eyed and blank.

民知其母
不知其父
與麋鹿共處
They knew their mothers
but not their fathers
and lived side by side with the elk and the deer.

耕而食
織而衣
無有相害之心
They plowed for their food,
wove for their clothing,
and had no thought in their hearts of harming one another.

此至德之隆也
This was Perfect Virtue at its height!

***

然而黃帝不能致德
"But the Yellow Emperor could not attain such virtue.

與蚩尤戰於涿鹿之野流血百里
He fought with Chi You in the field of Zhuolu
until the blood flowed for a hundred *li*.[^29-5]

堯舜作立群臣
Yao and Shun came to the throne, setting up a host of officials;
湯放其主
Tang banished his sovereign Jie;
武王殺紂
King Wu murdered his sovereign Zhou;
自是之後
以強陵弱
以眾暴寡
and from this time on,
the strong oppressed the weak,
the many abused the few.

湯武以來
皆亂人之徒也
From Tang and Wu until the present,
all have been no more than a pack of rebels and wrongdoers.

今子修文武之道
掌天下之辯以教後世
And now you come cultivating the ways of Kings Wen and Wu,
utilizing all the eloquence in the world in order
to teach these things to later generations!

縫衣淺帶矯言偽行
以迷惑天下之主而欲求富貴焉
In your flowing robes and loose-tied sash,
you speak your deceits and act out your hypocrisies,
confusing and leading astray the rulers of the world,
hoping thereby to lay your hands on wealth and eminence.

盜莫大於子
There is no worse robber than you!

天下何故不謂子為盜丘而乃謂我為盜跖
I don't know why, if the world calls me Robber Zhi,
it doesn't call you Robber Qiu!

***

子以甘辭說子路而使從之
使子路
去其危冠
解其長劍
而受教於子
天下皆曰
孔丘能止暴禁非
"With your honeyed words
you persuaded Zilu to become your follower,
to doff his jaunty cap, unbuckle his long sword,
and receive instruction from you,
so that all the world said,
'Kong Qiu knows how to suppress violence and put a stop to evil.'

其卒之也子路欲殺衛君而事不成
身菹於衛東門之上
But in the end Zilu tried to kill the ruler of Wei, bungled the job,
and they pickled his corpse
and hung it up on the eastern gate of Wei.

是子教之不至也
This was how little effect your teachings had on him![^29-6]

子自謂才士聖人邪
You call yourself a gentleman of talent, a sage?

則再逐於魯
Twice they drove you out of Lu;
削跡於衛
窮於齊
圍於陳
they wiped out your footprints in Wei,
made trouble for you in Qi,
and besieged you at Chen and Cai---
不容身於天下
no place in the empire will have you around!

子教子路菹此患
You gave instruction to Zilu,
and pickling was the disaster it brought him.

上無以為身
下無以為人
You can't look out for yourself to begin with,
or for others either---
子之道豈足貴邪
so how can this 'Way' of yours be worth anything?

***

世之所高莫若黃帝
黃帝尚不能全德
而戰涿鹿之野流血百里
"There is no one more highly esteemed by the world
than the Yellow Emperor,
and yet even the Yellow Emperor
could not preserve his virtue intact
but fought on the field of Zhuolu
until the blood flowed for a hundred *li*.

堯不慈
舜不孝
禹偏枯
湯放其主
武王伐紂
文王拘羑里
Yao was a merciless father,
Shun was an unfilial son,
Yu was half paralyzed,
Tang banished his sovereign Jie,
King Wu attacked his sovereign Zhou,
and King Wen was imprisoned at Youli.[^29-7]

此六子者世之所高也
孰論之皆以利惑其真而強反其情性
All these seven men[^29-8] are held in high esteem by the world,
and yet a close look shows that all of them, for the sake of gain,
brought confusion to the Truth within them,
that they forcibly turned against their true form and inborn nature.

其行乃甚可羞也
For doing so, they deserve the greatest shame!

***

世之所謂賢士伯夷叔齊
"When the world talks of worthy gentlemen,
we hear 'Bo Yi and Shu Qi.'

伯夷叔齊辭孤竹之君
而餓死於首陽之山骨肉不葬
Yet Bo Yi and Shu Qi declined the rulership of the state of Guzhu
and instead went and starved to death on Shouyang Mountain,
with no one to bury their bones and flesh.

鮑焦飾行非世
Bao Jiao made a great show of his conduct
and condemned the world;
抱木而死
he wrapped his arms around a tree and stood there till he died.

申徒狄諫而不聽
Shentu Di offered a remonstrance that was unheeded;
負石自投於河為魚鱉所食
he loaded a stone onto his back and threw himself into a river,
where the fish and turtles feasted on him.

介子推至忠也
自割其股以食文公
Jie Zitui was a model of fealty,
going so far as to cut a piece of flesh from his thigh
to feed his lord, Duke Wen.

文公後背之子推怒而去抱木而燔死
But later, when Duke Wen overlooked him, he went off in a rage,
wrapped his arms around a tree, and burned to death.[^29-9]

尾生與女子期於梁下
Wei Sheng made an engagement to meet a girl under a bridge.

女子不來
水至不去抱梁柱而死
The girl failed to appear and the water began to rise,
but instead of leaving, he wrapped his arms
around the pillar of the bridge and died.

此六子者無異於磔犬
流豕操瓢而乞者
These six men were no different from a flayed dog,
a pig sacrificed to the flood,
a beggar with his alms gourd in his hand.

皆離名輕死不念本養壽命者也
All were ensnared by thoughts of reputation
and looked lightly on death,
failing to remember the Source
or to cherish the years that fate had given them.

***

世之所謂忠臣者莫若王子比干
"When the world talks about loyal ministers, we are told
that there were none to surpass Prince Bi Gan and Wu Zixu.

伍子胥子胥沈江比干剖心
Yet Wu Zixu sank into the river,
and Bi Gan had his heart cut out.[^29-10]

此二子者世謂忠臣也
然卒為天下笑
These two men are called loyal ministers by the world,
and yet they ended up as the laughingstock of the empire.

自上觀之至於子胥比干皆不足貴也
Looking at all these men,
from the first I mentioned down to Wu Zixu and Bi Gan,
it is obvious that none is worth respecting.

***

丘之所以說我者
若告我以鬼事則我不能知也
"Now in this sermon of yours, Qiu,
if you tell me about the affairs of ghosts,
then I have no way of judging what you say.

若告我以人事者
But if you tell me about the affairs of men---
不過此矣
and it is no more than what you've said so far---
皆吾所聞知也
then I've heard it all already!

***

今吾告子
"And now I'm going to tell *you* something---
以人之情
about man's true form.

目欲視色
耳欲聽聲
口欲察味
志氣欲盈
His eyes yearn to see colors,
his ears to hear sound,
his mouth to taste flavors,
his will and spirit to achieve fulfillment.

人上壽百歲
A man of the greatest longevity will live a hundred years;
中壽八十
one of middling longevity, eighty years;
下壽六十
and one of the least longevity, sixty years.

除病瘦死喪憂患
其中開口而笑者
一月之中不過四五日而已矣
Take away the time lost in nursing illnesses,
mourning the dead, worry and anxiety,
and in this life there are no more than four or five days
in a month when a man can open his mouth and laugh.

天與地無窮
人死者有時
Heaven and earth are unending,
but man has his time of death.

操有時之具而託於無窮之間
Take this time-bound toy,
put it down in these unending spaces, and whoosh!---
忽然無異騏驥之馳過隙也
it is over as quickly as the passing of a swift horse
glimpsed through a crack in the wall!

不能
說其志意
養其壽命者
皆非通道者也
No man who is incapable of gratifying his desires
and cherishing the years that fate has given him
can be called a master of the Way.

丘之所言
What you have been telling me---
皆吾之所棄也
I reject every bit of it!

亟去走歸
Quick, now---be on your way.

無復言之
I want no more of your talk.

子之道狂狂汲汲
詐巧虛偽事也
非可以全真也
This 'Way' you tell me about is inane and inadequate,
a fraudulent, crafty, vain, hypocritical affair,
not the sort of thing that is capable of preserving the Truth within.

奚足論哉
How can it be worth discussing!"

***

孔子再拜趨走
Confucius bowed twice and scurried away.

出門上車執轡三失
目芒然無見色若死灰
Outside the gate, he climbed into his carriage
and fumbled three times in an attempt to grasp the reins,
his eyes blank and unseeing, his face the color of dead ashes.

據軾低頭不能出氣
Leaning on the crossbar, head bent down,
he could not seem to summon up any spirit at all.

***

歸到魯東門外適遇柳下季
Returning to Lu, 
he had arrived just outside the eastern gate of the capital
when he happened to meet Liuxia Ji.

柳下季曰
今者闕然數日不見
車馬有行色
"I haven't so much as caught sight of you
for the past several days," said Liuxia Ji,
"and your carriage and horses
look as though they've been out on the road---
得微往見跖邪
it couldn't be that you went to see my brother Zhi, could it?"

***

孔子仰天而歎曰
然
Confucius looked up to heaven, sighed, and said,
"I did."

***

柳下季曰
跖得無逆汝意若前乎
"And he was enraged by your views,
just as I said he would be?" said Liuxia Ji.

***

孔子曰
然
"He was,"
said Confucius.

丘所謂無病而自灸也
"You might say that I gave myself
the burning moxa treatment when I wasn't even sick.

疾走
料虎頭
編虎須
I went rushing off
to pat the tiger's head
and braid its whiskers---
幾不免虎口哉
and very nearly didn't manage to escape from its jaws!"

---

子張問於滿苟得曰
盍不為行
Zizhang said to Man Goude,
"Why don't you think more about your conduct?[^29-11]

無行則不信
No distinguished conduct means no trust;
不信則不任
no trust means no official position;
不任則不利
no official position means no gain.

故觀之名計之利而義真是也
So if it's reputation you have your eye on
or gain you're scheming for,
then righteous conduct is the real key.

若棄名利反之於心
則夫士之為行不可一日不為乎
And if you set aside considerations of reputation and gain
and return to the true nature of the heart,
then, too, I would say that you ought not to let a single day pass
without taking thought for your conduct."

***

滿苟得曰
無恥者富
Man Goude said,
"Those who are shameless get rich;
多信者顯
those who are widely trusted become famous.

夫名利之大者幾在無恥而信
The really big reputation and gain seem to go
to men who are shameless and trusted.

故觀之名計之利而信真是也
So if your eyes are set on reputation
and you scheme for gain,
then trust is the real key.

若棄名利反之於心則夫士之為行抱其天乎
And if you set aside considerations of reputation and gain
and return to the heart,
then in your conduct, I think you ought to hold fast
to the Heaven within you."[^29-12]

***

子張曰
昔者桀紂貴為天子
富有天下
Zizhang said,
"In ancient times, the tyrants Jie and Zhou
enjoyed the honor of being Son of Heaven
and possessed all the wealth of the empire.

今謂臧聚曰
汝行如桀紂
則有怍色有不服之心者
小人所賤也
Yet now if you say to a mere slave or groom,
'Your conduct is like that of a Jie or Zhou,'
he will look shamefaced and, in his heart,
will not acquiesce to such charges,
for even a petty man despises the names of Jie and Zhou.

仲尼墨翟窮為匹夫
Confucius and Mo Di, on the other hand,
were impoverished commoners.

今謂宰相曰
子行如仲尼墨翟
則變容易色稱不足者
士誠貴也
Yet now if you say to the highest minister of state,
'Your conduct is like that of Confucius or Mo Di,'
he will flush and alter his expression
and protest that he is not worthy of such praise,
for a gentleman sincerely honors their names.

故勢為天子未必貴也
窮為匹夫未必賤也
Therefore, to wield the power of a Son of Heaven
does not necessarily mean to be honored,
and to be poor and a commoner
does not necessarily mean to be despised.

貴賤之分
在行之美惡
The difference between being honored and being despised
lies in the goodness or badness of one's conduct."

***

滿苟得曰
小盜者拘
大盜者為諸侯
諸侯之門義士存焉
Man Goude said,
"The petty thief is imprisoned
but the big thief becomes a feudal lord,
and we all know that righteous gentlemen
are to be found at the gates of the feudal lords.

昔者桓公小白殺兄入嫂而管仲為臣
In ancient times, Xiaobo, Duke Huan of Qi,
murdered his elder brother and took his sister-in-law for a wife,
and yet Guan Zhong was willing to become his minister.

田成子常殺君竊國而孔子受幣
Chang, Viscount Tian Cheng,
murdered his sovereign and stole his state,
and yet Confucius was willing to receive gifts from him.[^29-13]

論則賤之
行則下之
In pronouncement they condemned them,
but in practice they bowed before them.

則是言行之情悖戰於胸中也
Think how this contradiction between the facts of word and deed
must have troubled their breasts!

不亦拂乎
Could the two help but clash?

故書曰
孰惡
So the book says,
Who is bad?

孰美
Who is good?

成者為首
不成者為尾
The successful man becomes the head,
the unsuccessful man becomes the tail."

***

子張曰
子不為行即將
疏戚無倫
貴賤無義
長幼無序
"But,"
said Zizhang,
"if you take no thought for conduct,
then there ceases to be
any ethical ties between near and distant kin,
any fitting distinctions between noble and humble,
any proper order between elder and younger.

五紀六位將何以為別乎
How is one to maintain the distinctions decreed by
the five moral principles and the six social relationships?"

***

滿苟得曰
堯殺長子
Man Goude said,
"Yao killed his eldest son;
舜流母弟
Shun exiled his mother's younger brother---
疏戚有倫乎
does this indicate any ethical ties
between near and distant kin?

湯放桀
Tang banished his sovereign Jie;
武王伐紂
King Wu killed his sovereign Zhou---
貴賤有義乎
does this indicate any fitting distinctions
between noble and humble?

王季為適
King Ji received the inheritance;
周公殺兄
the Duke of Zhou killed his elder brother---
長幼有序乎
does this indicate any proper order
between elder and younger?[^29-14]

儒者偽辭
墨者兼愛
The Confucians with their hypocritical speeches,
the Mohists with their talk of universal love---
五紀六位將有別乎
do these indicate any attempt
to maintain the distinctions decreed by
the five moral principles and the six social relationships?

且子正為名
我正為利
名利之實
不順於理
不監於道
Now your thoughts are all for reputation,
mine all for gain,
but neither reputation nor gain, in fact,
accords with reason
or reflects any true understanding of the Way.

吾日與子訟於無約曰
The other day when we referred the matter
to Wu Yue for arbitration, he gave this answer:[^29-15]

***

小人殉財
君子殉名
"'The petty man will die for riches,
the gentleman will die for reputation.

其所以
變其情
易其性
則異矣
In the manner in which
they alter their true form
and change their inborn nature,
they differ.

乃至於棄其所為而殉其所不為則一也
But insofar as they throw away what is already theirs
and are willing to die for something that is not theirs,
they are identical.

故曰
無為小人
So it is said,
Do not be a petty man---
反殉而天
return to and obey the Heaven within you;
無為君子
do not be a gentleman---
從天之理
follow the reason of Heaven.

若枉若直相而天極
Crooked or straight, pursue to the limit the Heaven in you.

面觀四方
Turn your face to the four directions;
與時消息
ebb and flow with the seasons.

若是若非執而圓機
Right or wrong, hold fast to the round center on which all turns;
獨成而意
in solitude bring your will to completion;
與道徘徊
ramble in the company of the Way.

無轉而行
Do not strive to make your conduct consistent;[^29-16]
無成而義
將失而所為
do not try to perfect your righteousness,
or you will lose what you already have.

無赴而富
Do not race after riches;
無殉而成
將棄而天
do not risk your life for success,
or you will let slip the Heaven within you.

比干剖心
Bi Gan's heart was cut out;
子胥抉眼
Wu Zixu's eyes were plucked from their sockets---
忠之禍也
loyalty brought them this misfortune.

直躬證父
Honest Gong informed on his father;
尾生溺死
Wei Sheng died by drowning---
信之患也
trustworthiness was their curse.

鮑子立乾
Bao Jiao stood there till he dried up;
申子不自理
Shenzi would not defend himself---
廉之害也
integrity did them this injury.

孔子不見母
Confucius did not see his mother;
匡子不見父
Kuangzi did not see his father---
義之失也
righteousness was their mistake.[^29-17]

此上世之所傳
下世之所語
These are the tales handed down from ages past,
retold by the ages that follow.

以為士者
正其言
必其行
故服其殃
離其患也
They show us that the gentleman who is
determined to be upright in word
and consistent in conduct will,
as a result, bow before disaster,
will encounter affliction.'"

無足問於知和曰
人卒未有不興名就利者
Never-Enough said to Sense-of-Harmony,
"After all, there are no men
who do not strive for reputation and seek gain.

彼富則人歸之
If you're rich, people flock to you;
歸則下之
flocking to you, they bow and scrape;
下則貴之
and when they bow and scrape, this shows they honor you.

夫見下貴者
To have men bowing and scraping, offering you honor---
所以長生安體樂意之道也
this is the way to ensure length of years,
ease to the body, joy to the will.

今子獨無意焉
And now you alone have no mind for these things.

知不足邪
Is it lack of understanding?

意知而力不能行邪
Or is it that you know their worth
but just haven't the strength to work for them?

故推正不忘邪
Are you, then, deliberately striving
'to be upright and never forgetful'?"

***

知和曰
今夫此人以為與己
同時而生
同鄉而處者
以為夫絕俗過世之士焉
Sense-of-Harmony said,
"You and your type look at
those who were born at the same time
and who dwell in the same community,
and you decide that you are gentlemen
who are far removed from the common lot,
who are superior to the times.

是專無主正所以覽
古今之時
是非之分也
This shows that you have no guiding principle by which to survey
the ages of past and present,
the distinctions between right and wrong.

與俗化世
去至重
棄至尊
以為其所為也
此其所以論長生
安體樂意之道
Instead you join with the vulgar in changing as the world changes,
setting aside what is most valuable,
discarding what is most worthy of honor,
thinking that there is something that has to be done,
declaring that this is the way to ensure length of years,
ease to the body, joy to the will---
不亦遠乎
but you are far from the mark indeed!

慘怛之疾
恬愉之安
The agitation of grief and sorrow,
the solace of contentment and joy---
不監於體
these bring no enlightenment to the body.

怵惕之恐
欣懽之喜
The shock of fear and terror,
the elation of happiness and delight---
不監於心
these bring no enlightenment to the mind.

知為為而不知所以為
You know you are doing what there is to do,
but you don't know why there should be things to do.

是以
貴為天子
富有天下
而不免於患也
This way, you might possess
all the honor of the Son of Heaven,
all the wealth of the empire,
and yet never escape from disaster."

***

無足曰
夫富之於人無所不利
"But,"
said Never-Enough,
"there is no advantage that riches cannot bring to a man---
窮美究埶
至人之所不得逮
賢人之所不能及
the ultimate in beauty, the heights of power,
things that the Perfect Man cannot attain to,
that the worthy man can never acquire.

俠人之勇力而不為威強
They buy the strength and daring of other men
that make one awesome and powerful;
秉人之知謀以為明察
they purchase the knowledge and schemes of other men
that make one wise and well informed;
因人之德以為賢良
they borrow the virtue of other men
that make one a man of worth and goodness.

非享國而嚴若君父
With no kingdom to reign over,
the rich man commands as much respect as a ruler or a father.

且夫聲色滋味權勢之於人
Beautiful sounds and colors, rich flavors, power and authority---
心不待學而樂之
體不待象而安之
a man need not send his mind to school
before it will delight in them,
need not train his body
before it will find peace in them.

夫欲惡避就
What to desire, what to hate, what to seek, what to avoid---
固不待師
no one needs a teacher in these matters;
此人之性也
they pertain to the inborn nature of man.

天下雖非我
Don't think this applies only to me.

孰能辭之[^rse-29-1]
Where is there a man in the whole world
who would be willing to give them up?"

***

知和曰
知者之為
故動以百姓不違其度
Sense-of-Harmony said,
"When the wise man goes about doing something,
he always moves for the sake of the hundred clans
and does not violate the rules.

是以足而不爭
Thus, if there is enough, he does not scramble for more.

無以為故不求
Having no reason to, he seeks nothing.

不足故求之
爭四處而不自以為貪
But if there is not enough, he seeks,
scrambling in all four directions,
yet he does not think of himself as greedy.

有餘故辭之
If there is a surplus, he gives it away.

棄天下而不自以為廉
He can discard the whole empire
and yet not think of himself as high-minded.

廉貪之實非以迫外也
Greed or high-mindedness, in fact,
have nothing to do with standards imposed from the outside---
反監之度
they represent a turning within
to observe the rules that are found there.

勢為天子而不以貴驕人
So a man may wield all the power of a Son of Heaven
and yet not use his high position to lord it over others;
富有天下而不以財戲人
he may possess all the wealth in the empire
and yet not exploit his riches to make a mockery of others.

計其患
慮其反
以為害於性
He calculates the risk,
thinks of what may be contrary and harmful to his inborn nature.

故辭而不受也
非以要名譽也
Therefore he may decline what is offered him,
but not because he hopes for reputation and praise.

堯舜為帝而雍
Yao and Shun ruled as emperors and there was harmony---
非仁天下也
but not because they sought to bring benevolence to the world;
不以美害生也
they would not have let 'goodness' injure their lives.

善卷許由得帝而不受
非虛辭讓也
Shan Quan and Xu You
had the opportunity to become emperors and declined,
but not because they wished to make an empty gesture of refusal;
不以事害己
they would not have let such matters bring harm to themselves.

此皆
就其利
辭其害
All these men
sought what was to their advantage
and declined what was harmful.

而天下稱賢焉則可以有之
The world praises them as worthies,
and it is all right if they enjoy such repute---
彼非以興名譽也
but they were not striving for any reputation or praise."

***

無足曰
必持其名
苦體絕甘約養以持生
"But in order to maintain a reputation like theirs,"
said Never-Enough,
"one must punish the body and give up everything sweet,
skimp and save merely to keep life going---
則亦久病長阨而不死者也
in which case one is no different from a man who goes on
year after year in sickness and trouble, never allowed to die!"

***

知和曰
平為福
有餘為害者
Sense-of-Harmony said,
"A just measure brings fortune,
an excess brings harm---
物莫不然而財其甚者也
this is so of all things,
but much more so in the case of wealth.

今富人
耳營鐘鼓筦籥之聲
The ears of the rich man are regaled with sounds
of bell and drum, flute and pipe;
口嗛於芻豢醪醴之味
以感其意
遺忘其業
his mouth is treated to the flavor
of grass- and grain-fed animals, of rich wine,
until his desires are aroused
and he has forgotten all about his proper business---
可謂亂矣
this may be called disorder.

侅溺於馮氣若負重行而上也
Mired and drowned by swelling passions,
he is like a man who carries a heavy load up the slope of a hill---
可謂苦矣
this may be called suffering.

貪財而取慰
Greedy for riches, he brings illness on himself;
貪權而取竭
greedy for power, he drives himself to exhaustion.
靜居則溺
In the quietude of his home, he sinks into languor;
體澤則馮
body sleek and well nourished, he is puffed up with passion---
可謂疾矣
this may be called disease.

為欲富就利
故滿若堵耳而不知避
且馮而不舍
In his desire for wealth, his search for gain,
he crams his rooms to overflowing, as it were,
and does not know how to escape,
yet he lusts for more and cannot desist---
可謂辱矣
this may be called shame.

財積而無用
服膺而不舍
滿心戚醮
求益而不止
More wealth piled up than he could ever use,
yet he is covetous and will not leave off,
crowding his mind with care and fatigue,
grasping for more and more with never a stop---
可謂憂矣
this may be called worry.

內則疑劫請之賊
At home he is suspicious of the inroads
of pilferers and inordinate demanders;
外則畏寇盜之害
abroad he is terrified
of the attacks of bandits and robbers.
內周樓疏
At home he surrounds himself with towers and moats;
外不敢獨行
abroad he dares not walk alone---
可謂畏矣
this may be called terror.

此六者[^rse-29-2]
These six
---disorder, suffering, disease, shame, worry, and terror---
天下之至害也
are the greatest evils in the world.

皆遺忘而不知察
Yet all are forgotten,
and he does not know enough to keep watch out for them.

及其患至求盡性竭財
單以反一日之無故而不可得也
And once disaster has come, then,
though he seeks with all his inborn nature
and exhausts all his wealth in hopes of returning
even for one day to the untroubled times,
he can never do so.

***

故觀之名則不見
"Therefore he who sets his eyes on reputation
will find that it is nowhere to be seen;
求之利則不得
he who seeks for gain
will find that it is not to be gotten.

繚意體而爭此
To entrap the mind and the body in a scramble for such things---
不亦惑乎
is this not delusion indeed?"
