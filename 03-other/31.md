## 31 漁父 The old fisherman

孔子遊乎緇帷之林
休坐乎杏壇之上
Confucius after strolling through the Black Curtain Forest,
sat down to rest on the Apricot Altar.[^31-1]

弟子讀書
孔子絃歌鼓琴
While his disciples turned to their books,
he strummed his lute and sang.

奏曲未半有漁父者下船而來
He had not gotten halfway through the piece he was playing
when an old fisherman appeared,
stepped out of his boat, and came forward.

須眉交白
His beard and eyebrows were pure white;
被髮揄袂
his hair hung down over his shoulders;
行原以上
and his sleeves flapped at his sides.

距陸而止
左手據膝
右手持頤以聽
He walked up the embankment,
stopped when he reached the higher ground,
rested his left hand on his knee,
propped his chin with his right,
and listened until the piece was ended.

曲終而招子貢子路二人俱對
Then he beckoned to Zigong and Zilu,
both of whom came forward at his call.

客指孔子曰
彼何為者也
The stranger pointed to Confucius and said,
"What does he do?"

子路對曰
魯之君子也
"He is a gentleman of Lu,"
replied Zilu.

***

客問其族
子路對曰
族孔氏
The stranger then asked what family he belonged to,
and Zilu replied,
"The Kong family."

***

客曰
孔氏者何治也
"This man of the Kong family,"
said the stranger,
"what's his occupation?"

***

子路未應子貢對曰
孔氏者
性服忠信
身行仁義
Zilu was still framing his reply when Zigong answered,
"This man of the Kong family
in his inborn nature adheres to loyalty and good faith,
in his person practices benevolence and righteousness;
飾禮樂
選人倫
he brings a beautiful order to rites and music
and selects what is proper in human relationships.

上以忠於世主
Above, he pays allegiance to the sovereign of the age;
下以化於齊民
將以利天下
below, he transforms the ordinary people through education
and, in this way, brings profit to the world.

此孔氏之所治也
Such is the occupation of this man of the Kong family!"

***

又問曰
有土之君與
"Does he have any territory that he rules over?"
asked the stranger,
pursuing the inquiry.

子貢曰
非也
"No,"
said Zigong.

侯王之佐與
"Is he the counselor to some king or feudal lord?"

子貢曰
非也
"No,"
said Zigong.

***

客乃笑而還行言曰
仁則仁矣
The stranger then laughed and turned to go,
saying as he walked away,
"As far as benevolence goes, he is benevolent all right.

恐不免其身
But I'm afraid he will not escape unharmed.

苦心勞形以危其真
To weary the mind and wear out the body,
putting the Truth in peril like this---
嗚乎遠哉其分於道也
alas, I'm afraid he is separated from the Great Way
by a vast distance indeed!"

***

子貢還報孔子
Zigong returned and reported to Confucius what had happened.

孔子推琴而起曰
其聖人與
Confucius pushed aside his lute, rose to his feet, and said,
"Perhaps this man is a sage!"

乃下求之
至於澤畔
方將杖拏而引其船
Then he started down the embankment after him,
reaching the edge of the lake
just as the fisherman was about to take up his punting pole
and drag his boat into the water.

顧見孔子還鄉而立
Glancing back and catching sight of Confucius,
he turned and stood facing him.

孔子反走再拜而進
Confucius hastily stepped back a few paces,
bowed twice, and then came forward.

客曰
子將何求
"What do you want?"
asked the stranger.

***

孔子曰
曩者先生有緒言而去
"A moment ago, sir,"
said Confucius,
"you made a few cryptic remarks and then left.

丘不肖未知所謂
Unworthy as I am, I'm afraid I do not understand what they mean.

竊待於下風
幸聞咳唾之音
以卒相丘也
If I might be permitted to wait on you with all due humility
and be favored with the sound of your august words,
my ignorance might in time be remedied."

***

客曰
嘻
"Goodness!"
exclaimed the stranger.

甚矣子之好學也
"Your love of learning is great indeed!"[^31-2]

***

孔子再拜而起曰
丘少而修學
以至於今六十九歲矣
Confucius bowed twice and then, straightening up, said,
"Ever since childhood I have cultivated learning,
until at last I have reached the age of sixty-nine.

無所得聞至教
But I have never yet succeeded in hearing the Perfect Teaching.

敢不虛心
Dare I do anything, then, but wait with an open mind?"

***

客曰
同類相從
"Creatures follow their own kind;
同聲相應
a voice will answer
to the voice that is like itself,"
said the stranger;
固天之理也
"this has been the rule of Heaven since time began.

吾請釋吾之所有而經子之所以
With your permission, therefore,
I will set aside for the moment my own ways
and try applying myself
to the things that you are concerned about.[^31-3]

子之所以者人事也
What you are concerned about are the affairs of men.

天子
諸侯
大夫
庶人
The Son of Heaven,
the feudal lords,
the high ministers,
the common people---
此四者自正治之美也
when these four are of themselves upright,
this is the most admirable state of order.

四者離位而亂莫大焉
But if they depart from their proper stations,
there is no greater disorder.

官治其職
人憂其事
乃無所陵
When officials attend to their duties
and men worry about their undertakings,
there is no overstepping of the mark.

***

故田荒室露
衣食不足
徵賦不屬
妻妾不和
長少無序
"Fields gone to waste, rooms unroofed,
clothing and food that are not enough,
taxes and labor services that you can't keep up with,
wives and concubines never in harmony,
senior and junior out of order---
庶人之憂也
these are the worries of the common man.

能不勝任
官事不治
行不清白
群下荒怠
功美不有
爵祿不持
Ability that does not suffice for the task,
official business that doesn't go right,
conduct that is not spotless and pure,
underlings who are lazy and slipshod,
success and praise that never come your way,
titles and stipends that you can't hold on to---
大夫之憂也
these are the worries of the high minister.

廷無忠臣
國家昏亂
工技不巧
貢職不美
春秋後倫
不順天子
A court lacking in loyal ministers,
a state and its great families in darkness and disorder,
craftsmen and artisans who have no skill,
articles of tribute that won't pass the test,
inferior ranking at the spring and autumn levees at court,
failure to ingratiate himself with the Son of Heaven---
諸侯之憂也
these are the worries of a feudal lord.

***

陰陽不和
寒暑不時以傷庶物
諸侯暴亂
擅相攘伐以殘民人
禮樂不節
財用窮匱
人倫不飭
百姓淫亂
"The yin and yang out of harmony,
cold and heat so untimely
that they bring injury to all things,
feudal lords violent and unruly,
wantonly attacking one another
till they all but destroy the common people,
rites and music improperly performed,
funds and resources that are forever giving out,
human relationships that are not ordered as they should be,
the hundred clans contumacious and depraved---
天子有司之憂也
these are the worries of the Son of Heaven and his chancellors.

今子既上無君侯有司之勢
而下無大臣職事之官
Now on the higher level,
you do not hold the position
of a ruler, a feudal lord, or a chancellor,
and on the lower level,
you have not been assigned to the office
of a high minister with its tasks and duties.

而擅
飭禮樂
選人倫
以化齊民
Yet you presume to
'bring a beautiful order to rites and music,
to select what is proper in human relationships'
and, in this way, to 'transform the ordinary people.'

不泰多事乎
This is undertaking rather a lot, isn't it?

***

且人有八疵
事有四患
"Moreover, there are eight faults that men may possess,
and four evils that beset their undertakings---
不可不察也
you must not fail to examine these carefully.

非其事而事之
謂之摠
To do what it is not your business to do
is called officiousness.

莫之顧而進之
謂之佞
To rush forward when no one has nodded in your direction
is called obsequiousness.

希意道言
謂之諂
To echo a man's opinions and try to draw him out in speech
is called sycophancy.

不擇是非而言
謂之諛
To speak without regard for what is right or wrong
is called flattery.

好言人之惡
謂之讒
To delight in talking about other men's failings
is called calumny.

析交離親
謂之賊
To break up friendships and set kinfolk at odds
is called maliciousness.

稱譽詐偽以敗惡人
謂之慝
To praise falsely and hypocritically
so as to cause injury and evil to others
is called wickedness.

不擇善否
兩容頰適偷拔其所欲
謂之險
Without thought for right or wrong,
to try to face in two directions at once
so as to steal a glimpse of the other party's wishes
is called treachery.

此八疵者
外以亂人
內以傷身
These eight faults
inflict chaos on others
and injury on the possessor.

君子不友
A gentleman will not befriend the man who possesses them;
明君不臣
an enlightened ruler will not have him for his minister.

***

所謂四患者
好經大事
變更易常以挂功名
"As for the four evils that I spoke of,
to be fond of plunging into great undertakings,
altering and departing from the old accepted ways,
hoping thereby to enhance your merit and fame---
謂之叨
this is called avidity.

專知擅事
侵人自用
To insist that you know it all,
that everything be done your way,
snatching from others and appropriating for your own use---
謂之貪
this is called avarice.

見過不更
聞諫愈甚
To see your errors but refuse to change,
to listen to remonstrance but go on behaving worse than before---
謂之很
this is called obstinacy.

人同於己則可
When men agree with you,
to commend them;
不同於己
雖善不善
when they disagree with you,
to refuse to see any goodness in them even when it is there---
謂之矜
this is called bigotry.

此四患也
These are the four evils.

能去八疵
無行四患
而始可教已
If you do away with the eight faults
and avoid committing the four evils,
then and only then will you become capable of being taught!"

***

孔子愀然而歎
Confucius looked chagrined and gave a sigh.

再拜而起曰
丘再逐於魯
Then he bowed twice, straightened up, and said,
"Twice I have been exiled from Lu;
削跡於衛
伐樹於宋
圍於陳蔡
they wiped away my footprints in Wei,
chopped down a tree on me in Song,
and besieged me between Chen and Cai.

丘不知所失而離此四謗者何也
I am aware of no error of my own,
and yet why did I fall victim to these four persecutions?"

***

客悽然變容曰
甚矣子之難悟也
A pained expression came over the stranger's face and he said,
"How hard it is to make you understand!

人有畏影惡跡而去之走者
Once there was a man who was afraid of his shadow
and who hated his footprints,
and so he tried to get way from them by running.

舉足愈數而跡愈多
But the more he lifted his feet and put them down again,
the more footprints he made.

走愈疾而影不離身
自以為尚遲疾走不休絕力而死
And no matter how fast he ran, his shadow never left him, and so,
thinking that he was still going too slowly,
he ran faster and faster without a stop
until his strength gave out and he fell down dead.

不知處陰以休影
處靜以息跡
He didn't understand that by lolling in the shade
he could have gotten rid of his shadow
and that by resting in quietude
he could have put an end to his footprints.

愚亦甚矣
How could he have been so stupid!

***

子審仁義之間
察同異之際
觀動靜之變
適受與之度
理好惡之情
和喜怒之節
"Now you scrutinize the realm of benevolence and righteousness,
examine the borders of sameness and difference,
observe the alternations of stillness and movement,
lay down the rules for giving and receiving,
regulate the emotions of love and hate,
harmonize the seasons of joy and anger---
而幾於不免矣
and yet you barely manage to escape harm.

謹修而身慎守其真
還以物與人則無所累矣
If you were diligent in improving yourself,
careful to hold fast to the Truth,
and would hand over external things to other men,
you could avoid these entanglements.

今不修之身而求之人
But now, without improving yourself,
you make demands on others---
不亦外乎
that is surely no way to go about the thing, is it?"

***

孔子愀然曰
請問何謂真
Confucius looked shamefaced and said,
"Please, may I ask what you mean by 'the Truth'?"

***

客曰
真者精誠之至也
The stranger said,
"By 'the Truth' I mean purity and sincerity in their highest degree.

不精不誠
不能動人
He who lacks purity and sincerity
cannot move others.

故強哭者雖悲不哀
Therefore he who forces himself to lament,
though he may sound sad,
will awaken no grief.

強怒者雖嚴不威
He who forces himself to be angry,
though he may sound fierce,
will arouse no awe.

強親者雖笑不和
And he who forces himself to be affectionate,
though he may smile,
will create no air of harmony.

真悲無聲而哀
True sadness need make no sound to awaken grief;
真怒未發而威
true anger need not show itself to arouse awe;
真親未笑而和
true affection need not smile to create harmony.

真在內者
神動於外
When a man has the Truth within himself,
his spirit may move among external things.

是所以貴真也
That is why the Truth is to be prized!

***

其用於人理也
"It may be applied to human relationships in the following ways:

事親則慈孝
In the service of parents,
it is love and filial piety;
事君則忠貞
in the service of the ruler,
it is loyalty and integrity;
飲酒則歡樂
in festive wine drinking,
it is merriment and joy;
處喪則悲哀
in periods of mourning,
it is sadness and grief.

忠貞以功為主
In loyalty and integrity,
service is the important thing;
飲酒以樂為主
in festive drinking,
merriment is the important thing;
處喪以哀為主
in periods of mourning,
grief is the important thing;
事親以適為主
in the service of parents,
their comfort is the important thing.

功成之美無一其跡矣
In seeking to perform the finest kind of service,
one does not always try to go about it in the same way.

事親以適不論所以矣
In ensuring comfort in the serving of one's parents,
one does not question the means to be employed.

飲酒以樂不選其具矣
In seeking the merriment that comes with festive drinking,
one does not fuss over what cups and dishes are to be selected.

處喪以哀無問其禮矣
In expressing the grief that is appropriate to periods of mourning,
one does not quibble over the exact ritual to be followed.

***

禮者世俗之所為也
"Rites are something created by the vulgar men of the world;
真者所以受於天也
the Truth is that which is received from Heaven.

自然不可易也
By nature it is the way it is and cannot be changed.

故聖人法天貴真不拘於俗
Therefore the sage patterns himself on Heaven, prizes the Truth,
and does not allow himself to be cramped by the vulgar.

愚者反此
The stupid man does the opposite of this.

不能法天而恤於人
He is unable to pattern himself on Heaven
and instead frets over human concerns.

不知貴真
祿祿而受變於俗
故不足
He does not know enough to prize the Truth,
but instead, plodding along with the crowd,
he allows himself to be changed by vulgar ways
and so is never content.

惜哉子之早湛於人偽而晚聞大道也
Alas, that you fell into the slough of human hypocrisy
at such an early age
and have been so late in hearing of the Great Way!"

***

孔子又再拜而起曰
今者丘得遇也若天幸然
Confucius once more bowed twice, straightened up, and said,
"Now that I have succeeded in meeting you,
it would seem as though Heaven has blessed me.

先生不羞而比之服役
而身教之
敢問舍所在
If, Master, you would not consider it a disgrace
for one like myself to enter the ranks of those who wait on you,
and to be taught by you in person,
then may I be so bold as to inquire where your lodgings are?

請因受業而卒學大道
I would like to be allowed to go there, receive instruction,
and at last learn the Great Way!"

***

客曰
吾聞之
可與往者與之至於妙道
The stranger replied,
"I have heard it said,
If it is someone you can go with,
then go with him to the very end of the mysterious Way;

不可與往者
不知其道
慎勿與之
but if it is someone you cannot go with,
someone who does not understand the Way,
then take care and have nothing to do with him---
身乃無咎
only then may you avoid danger to yourself.

子勉之
Keep working at it!

吾去子矣
吾去子矣
Now I will leave you,
I will leave you."

乃刺船而去延緣葦間
So saying, he poled away in his boat,
threading a path through the reeds.

***

顏淵還車
Yan Yuan brought the carriage around;
子路授綏
孔子不顧
待水波定
不聞拏音
而後敢乘
Zilu held out the strap for pulling oneself up,
but Confucius, without turning in their direction,
waited until the ripples on the water were stilled
and he could no longer hear the sound of the pole
before he ventured to mount.

***

子路旁車而問曰
由得為役久矣
未嘗見夫子遇人如此其威也
Zilu, following by the side of the carriage, said,
"I have been permitted to serve you for a long time, Master,
but I have never seen you encounter anyone
who filled you with such awe.

萬乘之主
千乘之君
見夫子
未嘗不分
庭伉禮
夫子猶有倨敖之容
The rulers of ten thousand chariots,
the lords of a thousand chariots,
when they receive you,
invariably seat you on the same level as themselves
and treat you with the etiquette due to an equal,
and still you maintain a stiff and haughty air.

今漁者
杖拏逆立
而夫子曲要磬折
言拜而應
But now this old fisherman,
pole in hand, presents himself in front of you,
and you double up at the waist, as bent as a chiming stone,[^31-4]
and bow every time you reply to his words---
得無太甚乎
this is going too far, isn't it?

門人皆怪夫子矣
Your disciples all are wondering about it.

漁人何以得此乎
Why should a fisherman deserve such treatment?"

***

孔子伏軾而歎曰
甚矣由之難化也
Confucius leaned forward on the crossbar, sighed, and said,
"You certainly are hard to change!

湛於禮義有間矣而樸鄙之心至今未去
All this time you have been immersed in
the study of ritual principles,
and you still haven't gotten rid of
your mean and servile ways of thinking.

進吾語汝
Come closer, and I will explain to you.

夫遇長不敬失禮也
To meet an elder and fail to treat him with respect
is a breach of etiquette.

見賢不尊不仁也
To see a worthy man and fail to honor him
is to lack benevolence.

彼非至人不能下人
If the fisherman were not a Perfect Man,
he would not be able to make other men
humble themselves before him.

下人不精不得其真
And if men, in humbling themselves before him,
lack purity of intention,
then they will never attain the Truth.

故長傷身
As a result, they will go on forever bringing injury on themselves.

惜哉
Alas!

不仁之於人也禍莫大焉
There is no greater misfortune than for a man to lack benevolence.

而由獨擅之
And yet you alone dare to invite such misfortune!

***

且道者萬物之所出也
"Moreover, the Way is the path by which
the ten thousand things proceed.

庶物失之者死
All things that lose it, die;
得之者生
all that get it, live.

為事逆之則敗
To go against it in one's undertakings is to fail;
順之則成
to comply with it is to succeed.

故道之所在聖人尊之
Hence, wherever the Way is to be found,
the sage will pay homage there.

今漁父之道可謂有矣
As far as the Way is concerned,
this old fisherman may certainly be said to possess it.

吾敢不敬乎
How, then, would I dare fail to show respect to him!"
