# Appendix: Richard John Lynn's notes

The following notes on when the various parts of the _Zhuangzi_
were written, and by whom, has been extracted from the introduction to
_Zhuangzi: a New Translation of the Sayings of Master Zhuang
as Interpreted by Guo Xiang_,
Richard John Lynn, 2022*

---

Although the _Zhuangzi_ has been popularly regarded
in both traditional and modern times
as the work of a single author,
Master Zhuang, Zhuang Zhou (fourth century BCE),
the overwhelming modern scholarly consensus
is that it was compiled probably over at least two centuries.
However, concerning the text,
which (except for fragments) exists
only in the thirty-three-chapter recension of Guo Xiang
that is divided into three sections,
_Neipian_ (Inner Chapters),
_Waipian_ (Outer Chapters),
and _Zapian_ (Miscellaneous Chapters),
agreement has never been reached either
on how its chronological layers should be stratified
or who contributed to its compilation,
either individually or as members of schools of thought.
Different ways of approaching the text,
based on textual analysis, have been proposed,
resulting in the reassignment of some passages
in the Inner Chapters to the Outer and Miscellaneous Chapters,
the movement of passages in them to the Inner Chapters,
and the classification of all chapters in terms of both chronological layers
and "school of thought" affiliations.
Earlier modern scholars
tended to accept that the Inner Chapters
were largely authored by Master Zhuang in the fourth century BCE,
and the other two sections
were product by later "schools" of Master Zhuang's followers;
but eventually, more sophisticated approaches appeared
that resulted in more detailed conclusions,
first significantly by Guan Feng (1919-2005) in 1961.[^lynn-189]
Guan's work was developed further by A. C. Graham in
"How Much of _Chuang Tzu_ Did Chuang Tzu Write?" (1980) and
_The Seven Inner Chapters and Other Writings from the Book Chuang Tzu_ (1981).
Working independently of Graham,
Liu Xiaogan covered similar ground but came
to somewhat different conclusions
in his Peking University doctoral dissertation (1985),
directed by Professor Zhang Dainian (1909-2004),
published as _Zhuangzi zhexue ji qi yanbian_
(Philosophy of the _Zhuangzi_ and its evolution).
The first three chapters of Liu's
work were translated as
_Classifying the Zhuangzi Chapters with an Afterword_ (1994),
in which Liu contrasts his dating and classification scheme with Graham's.

Graham proposes seven strata
and kinds of authorship in the _Zhuangzi_ as follows:

1. The Inner Chapters (1-7)
represent the actual writings of Master Zhuang,
including some passages in the Miscellaneous Chapters
in Guo Xiang's recension that rightly belong in the Inner Chapters.

1. Chapters 8-10 and the first part of 11
are authored by an individual "Primitivist" influenced by the _Laozi_.

1. Parts of chapter 11, chapters 12-16,
and chapter 33 are composed by an early Han school
of eclectic Daoists or "Syncretists" (early third century BCE).

1. Chapters 17-22 expound on and further develop
material in the Inner Chapters, and as such,
are from the later "School of Master Zhuang"
(third to second century BCE, perhaps into the early Han period).

1. Chapters 23-27 and 32 consist of heterogeneous fragments,
including some early material that rightfully belong
to the Inner Chapters (fourth-second centuries BCE).

1. Graham attributes chapters 28-31 to the "Yangists,"
narratives that are supportive of Yang Zhu's (370-319 BCE)
ethical egoism and can be dated
to the same time as the "Primitivists" (205 BCE).

1. The "Syncretists" is a collection of passages,
probably all from the early Han period,
that synthesize Confucian, Legalist, and Daoist thought
found in chapters 12, 13, and 14.

Liu proposes four divisions for the Zhuangzi:

1. Inner Chapters (1-7) (mid-Warring States period, fourth century BCE),
records of Master Zhuang's own teachings;

1. Group I Outer Chapters (17-22),
Miscellaneous Chapters (23-27 and 32),
are composed and compiled by "Transmitters and Expositors of Master Zhuang"
(late Warring States period before 235 BCE),
who explained and developed thought from the Inner Chapters,
as well as initiating thoughts of their own
that are different from that of the Inner Chapters,
and essentially tried to transcend
the conflicts between Confucians and Mohists;

1. Group II Outer Chapters (11B, 12-16, and 33)
(late Warring States period before 235 BCE)
represent the "Huang-Lao School" and assimilate and accommodate
several Confucian and Legalist points of view,
emphasizing the arts of the ruler
and expounding the principle
that he should be inactive while his ministers are active;

1. Group III Outer Chapters (8-11A),
Miscellaneous Chapters (28-31)
(late Warring States period before 235 BCE)
represent "The Anarchists,"
who reject "reality" as illusory,
seek the freedom of human nature,
and promote the idea that in a society of highest virtue,
neither distinction of ruler and subjects nor class consciousness exists.

Liu also insists that all of the Zhuangzi was completed by 241 BCE,
and none of it dates from as late as the early Han.

In the meantime, Harold Roth in "Who Compiled the Chuang Tzu?" (1991)
largely follows Graham's scheme, but he also argues,
agreeing with Guan Feng, that the compilation of the Zhuangzi,
which contains material composed and transmitted
for about two centuries (fourth to second century BCE)
should be attributed to Liu An (179-122 BCE),
the king of Huainan, and the Huainan scholars,
and the actual date of compilation can be narrowed down to about 130 BCE.

...[F]or a comprehensive critique of Graham's, Liu's, and Roth's work,
among others, as well as new perspectives and conclusions,
the reader is directed to Brian H. Hoffert,
"Chuang Tzu: The Evolution of a Taoist Classic"
(PhD dissertation, Harvard University, 2001).
After sifting through all the evidence and arguments presented,
Hoffert concludes that the fifty-two-chapter _Zhuangzi_
listed in the _Hanshu_ (History of the Former Han)
_Yiwen zhi_ (Treatise on Arts and Letters)
was indeed likely compiled by "Syncretists"
at the court of the prince of Huainan.[^lynn-190]
However, despite all this effort, much of the evidence
remains ambiguous as to which parts were originally composed when,
and by whom.

...Sima Qian referred to only four sections or chapter titles:
_Yufu_, "The Old Fisherman" (Guo's chapter 31),
_Dao Zhi_, "Robber Zhi" (chapter 29),
_Quque_, "Ransack Chests" (chapter 10),
and _Weilei xu Kangsang zi_,
"Master Kangsang of Weilei Mountain"
(apparently similar to "Gengsang Chu," chapter 23),[^lynn-193]
all of which belong to Guo's edited _Waipian_, "Outer Chapters"
and _Zapian_, "Miscellaneous Chapters."
None of these four belong to the first set of layers,
considered the most representative of the core ideas
of the Zhuangzi in the _Neipian_ "Inner Chapters."
Although surprising, this strongly suggests that the "Inner Chapters"
compiled by Guo Xiang did not yet exist
in a coherent form during Sima Qian's lifetime.

[^lynn-193]: The _Shiji suoyin_
(Explicating obscurities in the _Records of the Historian_)
of Sima Zhen (early eighth century)
interprets _Weilei xu_ and _Kangsang zi_
 as two separate chapters of the _Zhuangzi_,
the former identified with the sayings of a disciple of Master Lao,
known only as someone who supposedly lived on Weilei Mountain;
and the latter identified with Master Gengsang.
However, the _Shiji zhengyi_
(Correct meaning of the _Records of the Historian_) of Zhang Shoujie,
with a preface dated 737,
parses and interprets the text as I have rendered it previously,
as "Master Kangsang of Weilei Mountain,"
which is exactly how Gengsang Chu is identified
(though with variant characters) at the very beginning
of the _Gengsang Chu_ chapter in Guo Xiang's recension.
See _Shiji_, 63: 2144.
