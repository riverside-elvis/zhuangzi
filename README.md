# Appendix: Transcriber's notes

This is a mashup of Burton Watson's
_The Complete works of Zhuangzi_ (2013)
and the digital base text from Zhang Yuanji's
_Xu Guyi congshu 續古逸叢書_ found on
[ctext](https://ctext.org/zhuangzi).

Note that Watson based his translation on
Liu Wendian's _Zhuangzi bu zheng 莊子補正_,
but except for the difference between
simplified (_Zhuangzi bu zheng_)
and traditional (_Xu Guyi congshu_),
their base texts seem practically identical.
I've added notes where I think they differ.

Page number references in Watson's notes
are not accurate.
