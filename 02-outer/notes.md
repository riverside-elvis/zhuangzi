[^10-1]: That is, it was rich and fertile and had no wastelands.

[^10-2]: The assassination of the king of Qi took place in 481 BCE;
the actual usurpation of the state by the Tian family, in 386 BCE.
No one has satisfactorily explained the "twelve generations";
Yu Yue suggests that it is a copyist's error
for *shishi* (generation after generation).

[^10-3]: All four men attempted to give good advice
to their erring sovereigns and ended by being put to death
or forced to commit suicide.
On Guan Longfeng and Bi Gan, see p. 23;
on Chang Hong and Wu Zixu, see p. 227, n. 2.
I suppose this is meant to illustrate
how the rulers "stole" the wisdom of their counselors,
though it is hardly apt,
since all the rulers came to violent ends
as a result of their wickedness.

[^10-4]: At a gathering of the feudal lords at the court of Chu,
the ruler of Lu presented a gift of thin wine,
while the ruler of Zhao presented rich wine.
But the wine steward of Chu,
having failed to receive a bribe from the ruler of Zhao,
switched the gifts, and the ruler of Chu, angered,
attacked Zhao and laid siege to its capital, Handan.
Another version of the story asserts that the ruler of Chu,
angered at Lu's thin wine, attacked Lu;
and a third state, which had hitherto been intimidated by Chu's power,
took advantage of the opportunity to attack Chu's ally, Zhao.
In both versions, the saying is meant to illustrate
the existence of a causal connection between apparently unrelated phenomena.

[^10-5]: Tian Chang, Viscount Cheng of Qi,
who appeared as the "stealer" of the state of Qi,

[^10-8]: A skilled artisan of ancient times; see p. 153.

[^10-9]: The same saying appears in _Daodejing_ XLV.
But here it does not seem to fit the context,
and I suspect that as Wang Maohong suggested, it is an interpolation,
probably by someone who wished to establish a connection
between this passage and the _Daodejing_.

[^10-10]: Xuantong, a term also found in _Daodejing_ LVI.
Waley explains it there as a state
"in which there is a general perception
not effected through particular senses."

[^10-11]: As a means of reminding themselves of things;
they had no use for writing.
The men mentioned in this sentence appear to be mythical rulers of antiquity,
some mentioned in other early texts, some appearing only here.
The passage from this point on to the next to last sentence
is all but identical with a passage in _Daodejing_ LXXX.

[^10-12]: In late Zhou times, the feudal lords
competed to attract men of unusual intelligence and ability to their courts.
The state of Qi, which, as we have seen,
was ruled at the time by the Tian family,
was particularly famous for the inducements
that it offered to draw philosophers
from all over China to its state-sponsored academy.

[^10-13]: I follow Fukunaga in the interpretation
of the terms in this sentence.

[^10-14]: That is, to discard the concept of good;
I read *yi* as identical with the *yi* in the earlier parallel sentence.
