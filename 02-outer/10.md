## 10 胠篋 Rifling trunks

將為胠篋探囊發匱之盜而為守備
則必攝緘縢固扃鐍
If one is to guard and take precautions against thieves
who rifle trunks, ransack bags, and break open boxes,
then he must bind with cords and ropes
and make fast with locks and hasps.

此世俗之所謂知也
This the ordinary world calls wisdom.

然而巨盜至
則負匱揭篋擔囊而趨
唯恐緘縢扃鐍之不固也
But if a great thief comes along,
he will shoulder the boxes, hoist up the trunks,
sling the bags over his back, and dash off,
only worrying that the cords and ropes, the locks and hasps,
are not fastened tightly enough.

然則鄉之所謂知者
不乃為大盜積者也
In that case, the man who earlier was called wise
was in fact only piling up goods for the benefit of a great thief.

***

故嘗試論之
Let me try explaining what I mean.

世俗之所謂知者
有不為大盜積者乎
What the ordinary world calls a wise man
is in fact someone who piles things up
for the benefit of a great thief, is he not?

所謂聖者
有不為大盜守者乎
And what it calls a sage
is in fact someone who stands guard
for the benefit of a great thief, is he not?

何以知其然邪
How do I know this is so?

昔者齊國
鄰邑相望
雞狗之音相聞
In times past there was the state of Qi,
its neighboring towns within sight of one another,
the cries of their dogs and chickens within hearing of one another.

罔罟之所布
耒耨之所刺
方二千餘里
闔四竟之內
The area where its nets and seines were spread,
where its plows and spades dug the earth,
measured more than two thousand *li* square,
filling all the space within its four borders.[^10-1]

所以立宗廟社稷
治邑屋州閭鄉曲者
曷嘗不法聖人哉
And in the way its ancestral temples
and its altars of the soil and grain were set up,
its towns and villages and hamlets were governed,
was there anything that did not accord with the laws of the sages?

然而田成子一旦殺齊君而盜其國
Yet one morning Viscount Tian Cheng
murdered the ruler of Qi and stole his state.

所盜者豈獨其國邪
And was it only the state he stole?

並與其聖知之法而盜之
Along with it, he also stole the laws
that the wisdom of the sages had devised.

故田成子有乎盜賊之名而身處堯舜之安
Thus, although Viscount Tian Cheng
gained the name of thief and bandit,
he was able to rest as peacefully as a Yao or a Shun.

小國不敢非
The smaller states did not dare condemn him;
大國不敢誅
the larger states did not dare attack;
十二世有齊國
and for twelve generations,
his family held possession of the state of Qi.[^10-2]

則是不乃竊齊國
並與其聖知之法
以守其盜賊之身乎
Is this not a case in which a man, stealing the state of Qi,
along with it stole the laws of the sages' wisdom
and used them to guard the person of a thief and a bandit?

***

嘗試論之
Let me try explaining it.

世俗之所謂至知者
有不為大盜積者乎
What that ordinary world calls a man of perfect wisdom
is in fact someone who piles things up
for the benefit of a great thief;
所謂至聖者
有不為大盜守者乎
what the ordinary world calls a perfect sage
is in fact someone who stands guard
for the benefit of a great thief.

何以知其然邪
How do I know this is so?

昔者龍逢斬
In times past, Guan Longfeng was cut down;
比干剖
Bi Gan was disemboweled;
萇弘胣
Chang Hong was torn apart;
子胥靡
and Wu Zixu was left to rot.

故四子之賢而身不免乎戮
All four were worthy men,
and yet they could not escape destruction.[^10-3]

***

故盜跖之徒問於跖曰
盜亦有道乎
One of Robber Zhi's followers once asked Zhi,
"Does the thief, too, have a Way?"

***

跖曰
何適而無有道邪
Zhi replied,
"How could he get anywhere if he didn't have a Way?

夫妄意室中之藏聖也
Making shrewd guesses as to how much booty
is stashed away in the room is sageliness;
入先勇也
being the first one in is bravery;
出後義也
being the last one out is righteousness;
知可否知也
knowing whether or not the job can be pulled off is wisdom;
分均仁也
dividing up the loot fairly is benevolence.

五者不備而能成大盜者天下未之有也
No one in the world ever succeeded in becoming a great thief
if he didn't have all five!"

***

由是觀之
善人不得聖人之道不立
跖不得聖人之道不行
From this, we can see that
the good man must acquire the Way of the sage
before he can distinguish himself,
and Robber Zhi must acquire the Way of the sage
before he can practice his profession.

天下之善人少而不善人多
則聖人之利天下也少而害天下也多
But good men in the world are few,
and bad men many,
so in fact the sage brings little benefit to the world
but much harm.

故曰
脣竭則齒寒
Thus it is said,
"When the lips are gone, the teeth are cold;
魯酒薄而邯鄲圍
when the wine of Lu is thin, Handan is besieged."[^10-4]
聖人生而大盜起
And when the sage is born, the great thief appears.

***

掊擊聖人
縱舍盜賊
Cudgel and cane the sages,
and let the thieves and bandits go their way;
而天下始治矣
then the world will at last be well ordered!

夫川竭而谷虛
If the stream dries up, the valley will be empty;
丘夷而淵實
if the hills wash away, the deep pools will be filled up.

聖人已死則大盜不起
And if the sage is dead and gone,
then no more great thieves will arise.

天下平而無故矣
The world will then be peaceful and free of fuss.

***

聖人不死
大盜不止
雖重聖人而治天下
則是重利盜跖也
But until the sage is dead,
great thieves will never cease to appear,
and if you pile on more sages
in hopes of bringing the world to order,
you will only be piling up more profit for Robber Zhi.

為之斗斛以量之
則並與斗斛而竊之
Fashion pecks and bushels for people to measure by,
and they will steal by peck and bushel.[^10-5]

為之權衡以稱之
則並與權衡而竊之
Fashion scales and balances for people to weigh by,
and they will steal by scale and balance.

為之符璽以信之
則並與符璽而竊之
Fashion tallies and seals to ensure trustworthiness,
and people will steal with tallies and seals.

為之仁義以矯之
則並與仁義而竊之
Fashion benevolence and righteousness to reform people,
and they will steal with benevolence and righteousness.

何以知其然邪
How do I know this is so?

彼竊鉤者誅
He who steals a belt buckle pays with his life;
竊國者為諸侯
he who steals a state gets to be a feudal lord---
諸侯之門而仁義存焉
and we all know that benevolence and righteousness
are to be found at the gates of the feudal lords.

則是非竊仁義聖知邪
Is this not a case of stealing
benevolence and righteousness and the wisdom of the sages?

故逐於大盜揭諸侯竊仁義
並斗斛權衡符璽之利者
So men go racing in the footsteps of the great thieves,
aiming for the rank of feudal lord,
stealing benevolence and righteousness
and taking for themselves all the profits
of peck and bushel, scale and balance, tally and seal.

雖有軒冕之賞弗能勸
Though you try to lure them aside with rewards
of official carriages and caps of state,
you cannot move them;
斧鉞之威弗能禁
though you threaten them
with the executioner's ax,
you cannot deter them.

此重利盜跖而使不可禁者
This piling up of profits for Robber Zhi
to the point where nothing can deter him---
是乃聖人之過也
this is all the fault of the sage!

***

故曰
魚不可脫於淵
The saying goes,
"The fish should not be taken from the deep pool;
國之利器不可以示人
the sharp weapons of the state should not be shown to men."[^10-6]

彼聖人者天下之利器也
非所以明天下也
The sage is the sharp weapon of the world,
and therefore he should not be where the world can see him.[^10-7]

***

故絕聖棄知
大盜乃止
Cut off sageliness, cast away wisdom,
and then the great thieves will cease.

擿玉毀珠
小盜不起
Break the jades, crush the pearls,
and petty thieves will no longer rise up.

焚符破璽
而民朴鄙
Burn the tallies, shatter the seals,
and the people will be simple and guileless.

掊斗折衡
而民不爭
Hack up the bushels, snap the balances in two,
and the people will no longer wrangle.

殫殘天下之聖法
而民始可與論議
Destroy and wipe out the laws that the sage has made for the world,
and at last you will find that you can reason with the people.

***

擢亂六律
Discard and confuse the six tones;
鑠絕竽瑟
smash and unstring the pipes and lutes;
塞瞽曠之耳
stop up the ears of the blind musician Kuang;
而天下始
and for the first time;
人含其聰矣
the people of the world
will be able to hold on to their hearing.

滅文章
Wipe out patterns and designs;
散五采
scatter the five colors;
膠離朱之目
glue up the eyes of Li Zhu;
而天下始
人有其巧矣
and for the first time,
the people of the world
will be able to hold on to their eyesight.

毀絕鉤繩
Destroy and cut to pieces the curve and plumb line;
而棄規矩
throw away the compass and square;
攦工倕之指
shackle the fingers of Artisan Chui;[^10-8]
而天下始
and for the first time;
人有其巧矣
the people of the world
will possess real skill.

故曰
大巧若拙
Thus it is said,
"Great skill is like clumsiness."[^10-9]

削曾史之行
Put a stop to the ways of Zeng and Shi;
鉗楊墨之口
gag the mouths of Yang and Mo;
攘棄仁義
wipe out and reject benevolence and righteousness;
而天下之德始
玄同矣
and for the first time, the Virtue of the world
will reach the state of Mysterious Leveling.[^10-10]

***

彼人含其明則天下不鑠矣
When men hold on to their eyesight,
the world will no longer be dazzled.

人含其聰則天下不累矣
When men hold on to their hearing,
the world will no longer be wearied.

人含其知則天下不惑矣
When men hold on to their wisdom,
the world will no longer be confused.

人含其德則天下不僻矣
When men hold on to their Virtue,
the world will no longer go awry.

彼曾史楊墨師曠工倕離朱
皆外立其德而以爚亂天下者也
Men like Zeng, Shi, Yang, Mo,
Musician Kuang, Artisan Chui, or Li Zhu
all displayed their Virtue on the outside
and thereby blinded and misled the world.

法之所無用也
As methods go, this one is worthless!

***

子獨不知至德之世乎
Have you alone never heard of that age of Perfect Virtue?

昔者
容成氏大庭氏伯皇氏中央氏
栗陸氏驪畜氏軒轅氏赫胥氏
尊盧氏祝融氏伏羲氏神農氏
當是時也
民結繩而用之
Long ago, in the time of
Yong Cheng, Da Ting, Bo Huang, Zhong Yang,
Li Lu, Li Xu, Xian Yuan, He Xu,
Zun Lu, Zhu Rong, Fu Xi, and Shen Nong,
the people knotted cords and used them.[^10-11]

甘其食
美其服
樂其俗
安其居
They relished their food,
admired their clothing,
enjoyed their customs,
and were content with their houses.

鄰國相望
雞狗之音相聞
民至老死而不相往來
Though neighboring states were within sight of one another
and could hear the cries of one another's dogs and chickens,
the people grew old and died
without ever traveling beyond their own borders.

若此之時則至治已
At a time such as this,
there was nothing but the most perfect order.

***

今遂至使民延頸舉踵
But now something has happened
to make people crane their necks and stand on tiptoe.

曰某所有賢者贏糧而趣之
"There's a worthy man in such and such a place!" they cry,
and bundling up their provisions, they dash off.

則內棄其親
At home, they abandon their parents;
而外去其主之事
abroad, they shirk the service of their ruler.

足跡接乎諸侯之境
Their footprints form an unending trail
to the borders of the other feudal lords;
車軌結乎千里之外
their carriage tracks weave back and forth
a thousand *li* and more.

則是上好知之過也
This is the fault of men in high places who covet knowledge.[^10-12]

***

上誠好知而無道則天下大亂矣
As long as men in high places
covet knowledge and are without the Way,
the world will be in great confusion.

何以知其然邪
How do I know this is so?

夫弓弩畢弋機變之知多
Knowledge enables men to fashion
bows, crossbows, nets, stringed arrows, and like contraptions;
則鳥亂於上矣
but when this happens,
the birds flee in confusion to the sky.

鉤餌罔罟罾笱之知多
Knowledge enables men to fashion
fishhooks, lures, seines, dragnets, trawls, and weirs;
則魚亂於水矣
but when this happens,
the fish flee in confusion to the depths of the water.

削格羅落罝罘之知多
Knowledge enables men to fashion
pitfalls, snares, cages, traps, and gins;
則獸亂於澤矣
but when this happens,
the beasts flee in confusion to the swamps.

知詐漸毒頡滑堅白解垢同異之變多
則俗惑於辯矣
And the flood of rhetoric that enables men to invent
wily schemes and poisonous slanders,
the glib gabble of "hard" and "white,"
the foul fustian of "same" and "different,"
bewilder the understanding of common men.[^10-13]

故天下每每大亂
So the world is dulled and darkened by great confusion.

罪在於好知
The blame lies in this coveting of knowledge.

***

故天下皆知求其所不知
而莫知求其所已知者
In the world, everyone knows enough
to pursue what he does not know,
but no one knows enough
to pursue what he already knows.

皆知非其所不善
而莫知非其所已善者
Everyone knows enough to condemn
what he takes to be no good,
but no one knows enough to condemn
what he has already taken to be good.[^10-14]

是以大亂
［故上悖日月之明］
下爍山川之精
中墮四時之施
This is how the great confusion comes about,
\[blocking the light of the sun and moon above,][^rse-10-1]
searing the vigor of hills and streams below,
overturning the round of the four seasons in between.

惴耎之蟲
肖翹之物
莫不失其性
There is no insect that creeps and crawls,
no creature that flutters and flies,
that has not lost its inborn nature.

甚矣夫好知之亂天下也
So great is the confusion of the world
that comes from coveting knowledge!

***

自三代以下者是已
From the Three Dynasties on down,
it has been this and nothing else---
舍夫種種之民而悅夫役役之佞
shoving aside the pure and artless people
and delighting in busy, bustling flatterers;
釋夫恬淡無為而悅夫啍啍之意
abandoning the limpidity and calm of inaction
and delighting in jumbled and jangling ideas.

啍啍已亂天下矣
And this jumble and jangle has for long confused the world.
