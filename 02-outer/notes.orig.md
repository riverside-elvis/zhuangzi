[^8-1]: Virtue (*de*) here seems to mean inner power or vital force;
see p.
58,
n.
10.
This and the following three sections are much closer in thought to the _Daodejing_ of Laozi than the preceding sections,
and the use of the word *de* seems to accord with its use in the _Daodejing_.
Also,
here we encounter for the first time in Zhuangzi the term *xing* or "inborn nature," which is so important to Confucian thought.

[^8-2]: The five vital organs---liver,
lungs,
heart,
kidneys,
and spleen---were related to the five elements and later to the five Confucian virtues---benevolence,
propriety,
good faith,
righteousness,
wisdom.

[^8-3]: Also called Li Lou;
noted for his exceptionally keen eyesight.

[^8-4]: Famous musician mentioned on p.
12.
With this passage,
compare _Daodejing_ XII: "The five colors confuse the eye,
the five sounds dull the ear."

[^8-5]: Zeng Shen,
a disciple of Confucius,
and Shih Yu,
historiographer of the state of Wei,
paragons of benevolence and righteousness,
respectively.

[^8-6]: All seem to be building metaphors,
though the meaning of the last is doubtful.
I read *gou* instead of *ju*.

[^8-7]: The hedonist philosopher Yang Zhu and the advocate of universal love Mo Di.
We would expect a reference to the logicians,
however,
since they were the ones who argued about "hard," "white," etc.;
see p.
12,
n.
9.

[^8-8]: Reading *zhizheng* as in the preceding sentence.

[^8-9]: At this point,
the meaning of the symbolism seems to shift (with some violence to the logic of the argument).
The webbed toes and extra fingers,
which earlier represented the forced and unnatural morality of Confucianism,
now become natural deformities such as we have seen in the earlier chapters,
which it would be wrong to try to correct.

[^8-10]: Following Ma Xulun's interpretation.

[^8-11]: The Xia,
Shang,
and Zhou dynasties.

[^8-12]: Following Fukunaga,
I read *tong* with the man radical.
A similar phrase,
*tonghu*,
appears in sec.
9,
and *tongran* in sec.
23.

[^8-13]: The sage ruler Shun,
idol of the Confucian philosophers.

[^8-14]: An unusual slave boy who,
in true Confucian fashion,
was attempting to improve his mind.

[^8-15]: On Bo Yi,
the model of righteousness;
see p.
126,
n.
3;
Robber Zhi,
who appears later as the subject of sec.
29,
represents the ultimate in greed and violence.

[^8-16]: Apparently a famous chef and connoisseur of flavor.

[^8-17]: This clause is excessively wordy and merely repeats what was said earlier.
I suspect that it is corrupt and that in its original form it contained some reference to the five flavors.

[^9-1]: Frequently mentioned in early texts as an expert judge of horses.

[^9-2]: Reading *tong* with the man radical;
see p.
62,
n.
12.

[^9-3]: The terms *su* and *pu* (uncarved simplicity),
appear frequently in the _Daodejing_,
for example,
ch.
XIX.
Waley translates them as "Simplicity" and "the Uncarved Block," respectively.

[^9-4]: There are many different interpretations of the terms in this sentence.
I follow Ma Xulun's emendations and interpretations.

[^9-5]: Following texts that read *neng* rather than *tai*.

[^9-6]: Legendary ruler of high antiquity.

[^11-1]: The words "restless and aspiring" represent four characters in the original whose meaning is very doubtful.

[^11-2]: A similar saying is found in _Daodejing_ XIII,
though the wording is somewhat different.

[^11-3]: Daoist writers ordinarily have only praise for the Yellow Emperor,
and in Han times Daoism was known as *Huanglao*,
the teaching of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi.
It is surprising,
therefore,
to find him cited here as the prime meddler,
though this is typical of the shifting roles assigned to the figures who appear in the _Zhuangzi_.
It is unclear whether the following section should be taken as a continuation of Laozi's speech or as the words of the writer;
I have taken it as the latter.

[^11-4]: These banishments of evil and insubordinate men are mentioned in the _Book of Documents_,
"Canon of Shun," in which their presence has long raised the troubling question of why there should have been any unsubmissive men during the rule of a sage.

[^11-5]: Following Zhang Binglin's interpretation.

[^11-6]: That is,
the yin and yang,
being two,
already represent a departure from the primal unity of the Way.
What Master Guang Cheng is objecting to,
of course,
is the fact that the Yellow Emperor wishes to "control" them.

[^11-7]: The Chinese ruler,
when acting as sovereign,
faces south.
Master Guang Cheng,
by assuming the same position,
indicates his spiritual supremacy.

[^11-8]: The term "Bright One" (*huang*) was originally an epithet for Heaven or a being commanding respect and awe,
such as the sage rulers of antiquity.

[^11-9]: The meaning is doubtful.

[^11-10]: Cloud Chief and Big Concealment are inventions of the writer,
the latter apparently representing the Daoist sage.
Fuyao appeared in sec.
1 as a name for the whirlwind;
here perhaps it is an error for Fusang,
a huge mythical tree in the eastern sea from whose branches the sun rises.

[^11-11]: Traditionally defined as the breaths of the yin,
yang,
wind,
rain,
darkness,
and light.

[^11-12]: "Mind-nourishment" may seem an odd thing to recommend,
particularly as the whole anecdote is directed against purposeful "governing" or "nourishing." But this is typical of Daoist paradox.
As we soon see,
it does not in fact mean what it seems to mean.

[^11-13]: Probably a reference to the itinerant statesmen-advisers of late Zhou times who wandered about offering their services to the various feudal lords.

[^11-14]: I follow Fukunaga in punctuating after the first *wu*.

[^11-15]: Following Yu Yue's interpretation.

[^11-16]: Following Zhang Binglin's interpretation.

[^11-17]: The remainder of the chapter,
with its recognition of the necessity for benevolence,
righteousness,
law,
ritual,
etc.,
seems to clash violently with what has gone before.
Some commentators interpret it as a description of the kind of compromise that even the perfect Daoist ruler must make if he is to rule effectively.
Others regard it as an interpolation or a passage misplaced from some other section.
See the similar passage on p.
79.

[^11-18]: Following Ma Xulun's interpretation.

[^12-1]: Perhaps a reference to the Confucian doctrine of the rectification of names,
that is,
the necessity to make certain that the one who is called "ruler" is in fact a true ruler,
etc.
The writer of this chapter seems to be attempting to effect a compromise between Daoist and Confucian ideals of government.

[^12-2]: *Yi*,
elsewhere translated as "righteousness."

[^12-3]: As pointed out by commentators,
the position of the *de* and that of the *dao* in the next sentence should be reversed to match the order of the sorites that follows.
But the text is probably faulty.

[^12-4]: It is not known what "Record" the writer is quoting.

[^12-5]: The Master has been variously identified as Laozi,
Zhuangzi,
or Confucius.

[^12-6]: Compare _Daodejing_ XXI: "shadowy and indistinct,
within it is a thing;
dim and dark,
within it is an essence."

[^12-7]: That is,
he accommodates himself to external phenomena as a traveler accommodates himself to the conditions of the journey.
In the main,
I follow Fukunaga's interpretation,
though the sentence is very obscure.

[^12-8]: Following Ma Xulun,
I read *bang* (slander) in place of *fang*.

[^12-9]: Following Sun Yirang,
I read *lei* in place of *si*;
compare the parallel passage on p.
56.

[^12-10]: Confucius's familiar name.
In using it to address Confucius face to face,
Laozi is expressing great familiarity and/or contempt.

[^12-11]: Following texts that read *ju* (agitated) in place of *chu*.

[^12-12]: Confucius.

[^12-13]: On Mr.
Chaos (Hundun),
see p.
59.

[^12-14]: That is,
the true man of the Way does not retire from the world or reject society and its inventions.

[^12-15]: The names of the persons in the anecdote are allegorical,
Zhun Mang meaning something like "Artless and Forgetful" and Yuan Feng meaning "Little Wind."

[^12-16]: If they were viewing the actual troops,
the episode must be set in the eleventh century BCE,
when King Wu of the Zhou attacked and overthrew the last ruler of the Shang dynasty.
But perhaps they were watching the court dances performed in later ages that reenacted the campaign.
The "man of the Yu clan" in the following sentence is the sage ruler who did not have to launch any military expeditions.

[^12-17]: Because it is the duty of the son and minister to reprimand his parents and lord,
respectively,
when they are clearly in the wrong.

[^12-18]: Following texts that omit the *zui* and adopting Chu Boxiu's interpretation;
the reference is apparently to the rhetoricians.

[^12-19]: Following Lu Deming's emendations.

[^12-20]: Is this sentence intended to belong with what precedes it or with what follows it?

I am unable to tell.

[^12-21]: On Yangzi and Mozi,
see p.
61,
n.
7.
They preached acceptance and rejection,
repectively,
of sensual pleasure.

[^12-22]: These last two paragraphs,
with their mention of Robber Zhi,
Zeng,
and Shi,
and discussion of the five notes,
flavors,
etc.,
are close in thought and terminology to the preceding sections.
Speculation is that they originally belonged to either sec.
9 or sec. 11.

[^13-1]: Following texts that read *bei* in place of *lun*.

[^13-2]: Shun served as a minister under Yao before Yao ceded the throne to him;
hence here he represents the ideal minister.

[^13-3]: See p.
52,
where these words are attributed to Xu You.

[^13-4]: Reading *zhou* instead of *diao* in accordance with Zhang Binglin's interpretation.

[^13-5]: The "three armies" refers to the three-divisioned army of a feudal state.
The five weapons are usually listed as spear,
halberd,
battle-ax,
shield,
and bow,
though there are other lists.
The five penalties are usually given as tattooing,
cutting off the nose,
cutting off the feet,
castration,
and death.

[^13-6]: That is,
the correspondence between an official's title and his actual performance in office,
an important principle in Legalist doctrine.

[^13-7]: Music here includes the dance,
in which feathers and tassels made of yak tails were used.

[^13-8]: It is not known what book the writer is quoting.
The whole passage appears to be an attempt to combine Daoist,
Confucian,
and Legalist terminology and concepts of government into one comprehensive system,
the sort of eclecticism often found in thinkers of the Qin and early Han.

[^13-9]: Reading *deng* in place of *de*,
and *tu* in place of *chu*,
in accordance with the emendations by Zhang Binglin and Sun Yirang,
respectively.

[^13-10]: There are various explanations of the phrase "Twelve Classics," for example,
the Six Confucian Classics with six commentaries,
or the _Spring and Autumn Annals_,
which covers the reigns of twelve dukes of Lu.

[^13-11]: Reading *yi* (pleased) in place of *wu* in accordance with Zhang Binglin's emendation.

[^13-12]: Reading *pu* in place of *mu* to correspond to the parallel sentence in sec.
14,
p.
115.

[^13-13]: One can easily gather from the _Daodejing_ that Laozi favored frugality,
but nothing is known about these legends of his personal stinginess and lack of charity to his little sister.

[^13-14]: Following Ma Xulun's emendation and interpretation.

[^13-15]: A Legalist term;
see _Han Feizi_,
sec.
7,
where punishment and favor are called "the two handles" of political power.

[^13-16]: Reading *bin* with the hand radical.

[^13-17]: The section in quotation marks is identical with the beginning of _Daodejing_ LVI.

[^14-1]: The expression "clouds and rain" was used from early times to refer to sexual intercourse,
and this may be why the writer employs the odd phrase "lascivious joy."

[^14-2]: Reading *zhao* with the hand radical,
as Ma Xulun suggested.

[^14-3]: Usually taken to be the five elements of Chinese philosophy: wood,
fire,
earth,
metal,
and water.

[^14-4]: Probably a reference to the "Great Plan" section of the _Book of Documents_,
which is in nine divisions and was supposed to have been written on the back of a tortoise that emerged from the Luo River.

[^14-5]: On the August Ones,
see p.
113,
n.
15.

[^14-6]: Shang here presumably means the state of Song;
see the introduction,
p.
viii.

[^14-7]: The thirty-five characters that make up this sentence are omitted in some editions because there is strong suspicion that they are part of a commentary that was erroneously copied into the body of the text.

[^14-8]: Following Ma Xulun's interpretation.

[^14-9]: Following the texts that read *zi* instead of *yu*.

[^14-10]: Since in the preceding passage,
the order of the verbs was "understand," "see," and "catch up," this sentence probably began originally with a clause describing Cheng's inability to understand,
of which only the single character *zhi* now remains.

[^14-11]: As the reader well may feel at this point.
On the whole,
I follow Fukunaga in the interpretation of this difficult and deliberately paradoxical passage,
though I am not confident that I really understand what it is all about.
It should be noted that because the words for "joy" and "music" are written with the same character,
phrases translated here as "perfect music," "the music of Heaven," etc.,
can also be interpreted to refer to the states of emotion.
The phrase "perfect music" in fact appears later as the title of sec.
18,
where I have rendered it as "Supreme Happiness."

[^14-12]: Yan Yuan,
or Yan Hui,
was Confucius's favorite disciple.
Music Master Jin was presumably an official of Confucius's native state of Lu.

[^14-13]: The straw dogs,
also mentioned in _Daodejing_ V,
apparently acted as scapegoats to draw off evil influences at the sacrifice;
hence they were treated with reverence before the sacrifice but thrown away afterward,
and to attempt to put them back in their original boxes would only invite bad luck.

[^14-14]: These various difficulties and persecutions that Confucius and his disciples encountered in their wanderings from state to state are mentioned in the _Analects_ or other early texts;
here,
as earlier,
the name Shang seems to stand for Song.

[^14-15]: The Three August Ones (*huang*) and Five Emperors (*di*) are legendary sage rulers of high antiquity,
though it is not certain just which of the numerous legendary rulers the writer would have included in his list of three and five.
Later on in the chapter,
the phrase seems to mean sage rulers in general.

[^14-16]: There are other ways to interpret this perplexing passage.
The point is that the Way can be transmitted only telepathically,
and therefore the sage must make certain that the mind of the other party is capable of receiving it before he extracts it from his own mind and hands it over.

[^14-17]: On one level,
this refers to the ruler,
who rules by means of punishments,
rewards,
etc.;
*zheng* (to correct) is etymologically the same as *zheng* (to govern).
On another level,
the passage is talking about the enlightened man who has a "correct" understanding of the Way.

[^14-18]: Following texts that read *kui* in place of *fen*.

[^14-19]: Following texts that read *huan* in place of *guan*.

[^14-20]: The sentence is obscure.
It is apparent from Guo Xiang's note that he took it as a reference to incest,
although later commentators,
repelled or unconvinced by his interpretation,
have suggested various other interpretations or emendations.

[^14-21]: That is,
the older child is weaned when the younger is born;
the phrase signifies mammalian birth,
as opposed to the other three types of reproduction mentioned earlier.

[^15-1]: In this last sentence,
which describes the practitioner of Induction (*daoyin*),
a kind of yoga technique involving exercises and breath control.
I follow Waley's translations of technical terms such as "bear-hangings" and "bird-stretchings," whose meaning can only be guessed.
See Waley's _Three Ways of Thought in Ancient China_,
p.
44.

[^15-2]: The word *jing* is being used in this passage in a number of different ways,
a fact that is very difficult to bring out in translation.
At the beginning of the paragraph,
*jing*,
translated as "spiritual essence," means the vital energy of the body;
later the word appears as an adjective in the compound "pure spirit" (*jingshen*),
that is,
vital or essential spirit.
Finally,
it appears as a noun,
"essence," or "purity." Because it may also mean "semen," the passage can be interpreted as dealing with the sexual regimen.

[^16-1]: I punctuate after *xue* and *si*.
The writer is attacking both the Confucian and Mohist ideals of moral training and those schools of thought that advocated the lessening or elimination of desire.

[^16-2]: This passage,
which attempts to derive the Confucian virtues and concerns from the Way,
presents many difficulties in interpretation.
Probably the text is faulty---judging from the parallelism;
for example,
"good faith" ought to have a definition of its own instead of being part of the definition of "rites." I follow Fukunaga's interpretation.

[^16-3]: All these figures are mythical rulers or cultural heroes;
Suiren and Shennong are the discoverers of fire and agriculture,
respectively.

[^16-4]: As Fukunaga pointed out,
this concept of good and bad times that are fated is quite contrary to the philosophy expressed in the inner chapters,
according to which any time is as good as any other.
The thinking here is,
in fact,
much closer to the ideas of timeliness and fate expressed in the Confucian _Analects_ or the _Book of Changes_.

[^16-5]: Why the writer quotes such an un-Daoist injunction as "Rectify yourself," or what he means by it,
I do not know.

[^17-1]: The Lord of the River,
the god of the Yellow River,
appeared on p.
45,
under the name Pingyi.

[^17-2]: The god of the sea.

[^17-3]: Bo Yi,
who relinquished his kingdom to his brother and later chose to die of starvation rather than serve a ruler he considered unjust,
was regarded as a model of righteousness.

[^17-4]: The Lord of the River has literally come to the gate of the sea.
But a second meaning is implied,
that is,
"If I hadn't become your disciple."

[^17-5]: Said by some commentators to be a huge fiery stone against which seawater turns to steam.

[^17-6]: As it stands in the original,
this sentence makes little sense to me,
and the translation represents no more than a tentative attempt to extract some meaning.

[^17-7]: The Five Emperors were five legendary rulers of high antiquity,
of whom the Yellow Emperor,
Yao,
and Shun are the most famous.
The Three Kings were the founders of the Three Dynasties,
the Xia,
the Shang,
and the Zhou.

[^17-8]: A play on the homophones *de* (virtue) and *de* (gain,
or acquisition).

[^17-9]: In 316 BCE,
King Kuai of Yan was persuaded to imitate the example of Yao by ceding his throne to his minister Zi Zhi.
In no time the state was torn by internal strife,
and three years later it was invaded and annexed by the state of Qi.

[^17-10]: Tang and Wu were the founders of the Shang and Zhou dynasties,
respectively.
Duke Bo was a scion of the royal family of Chu who led an unsuccessful revolt against its ruler and was defeated and forced to commit suicide in 479 BCE.

[^17-11]: I follow Fukunaga's interpretation of these terms.

[^17-12]: Actually,
the text reads "gain" (*de*);
perhaps this is merely a mistake for the *de* meaning "virtue," or perhaps a play on the two words is intended.
See p.
129,
n.
8.

[^17-13]: A being with only one leg.
Sometimes it is des cribed as a spirit or a strange beast,
sometimes as a historical personage---the Music Master Kui.

[^17-14]: The _Analects_ twice states (IX,
5;
XI,
22): "The Master was put in fear in Kuang." It is said that the people of the state in which Kuang was situated,
here identified as Song,
mistook Confucius for an enemy of theirs named Yang Huo.

[^17-15]: A man who is willing to sacrifice his life to save others or to preserve his honor.

[^17-16]: The logician Gongsun Long,
who spent much time discussing the concepts of sameness and difference or the relationship of attributes such as hardness and whiteness to the thing they qualify,
was mentioned on p.
10,
n.
7,
and p.
12,
n.
9.
Prince Mou of Wei was the reputed author of a Daoist work in four sections that is no longer extant.

[^17-17]: The underworld.

[^18-1]: See p.
134,
n.
15.

[^18-2]: Wu Zixu,
minister to the king of Wu,
repeatedly warned the king of the danger of attack from the state of Yue.
He finally aroused the king's ire and suspicion and was forced to commit suicide in 484 BCE.

[^18-3]: These all are places or persons associated in Chinese legend with immortality.
The Yellow Emperor,
as we have seen on pp.
45–46,
did not die but ascended to Heaven.

[^18-4]: According to the more prosaic interpretation of Li Ciming,
the character for "willow" is a loan for the word "tumor."

[^18-5]: Yan Yuan or Yan Hui,
who appeared earlier,
was Confucius's favorite disciple.

[^18-6]: Guan Zhong,
a seventh-century statesman of Qi whom Confucius,
judging from the _Analects_,
admired.

[^18-7]: Suiren and Shennong are mythical culture heroes,
the discoverers of fire and agriculture,
respectively.

[^18-8]: Following Yu Yue's interpretation.

[^18-9]: The text of this paragraph,
a romp through ancient Chinese nature lore,
is doubtful at many points.

[^19-1]: I follow the text as it stands,
though it would perhaps be preferable to adopt Ma Xulun's suggestion,
dropping the *min* and translating "and you will be close to the attainment of Truth."

[^19-2]: Following the interpretation of Yu Yue,
who supplies a *wu* after the *wan*.

[^19-3]: That is,
stick to a happy medium.

[^19-4]: Duke Huan of Qi (r.
685–643 BCE) later became the first of the *ba*---dictators or hegemons who imposed their will on the other feudal lords.
Guan Zhong (d.
645 BCE) was his chief minister.
As a special mark of esteem,
the duke customarily addressed him as "Father Zhong."

[^19-5]: Following Yu Yue's emendation and interpretation.

[^19-6]: The one-legged creature who appeared on p.
133.

[^19-7]: A carpenter of Lu,
mentioned in the _Zuozhuan_ under Duke Xiang,
fourth year (569 BCE).

[^19-8]: That is,
matching his own innate nature with that of the tree.

[^19-9]: Zao Fu was a famous master of the art of carriage driving.
I emend *wen* to *fu*.

[^19-10]: A Daoist term for the mind.

[^19-11]: The same saying is found in the _Daodejing_,
secs.
X and LI.

[^19-12]: The text of the last part of the sentence appears to be corrupt,
and I make little sense of it.
The same anecdote,
in somewhat more detailed form,
appeared on p.
143.

[^20-1]: Following the emendation suggested by Yu Yue.
The word "things" in this passage includes mankind.

[^20-2]: Xiong Yiliao,
a man of Chu,
is mentioned in _Zuozhuan_,
Duke Ai,
sixteenth year (479 BCE);
the "marquis of Lu" is presumably the Duke Ai of Lu.

[^20-3]: That is,
they never venture forth in groups.
I follow texts that read *qie* in place of *dan* and adopt Ma Xulun's interpretation of *xusu*.

[^20-4]: Meaning very doubtful;
Ma Xulun opines that something has dropped out of the text.

[^20-5]: There were sixteen bells in a set,
arranged in two tiers.
Most commentators take the "platform" to be an altar on which a sacrifice was made in preparation for the casting of the bells,
though Ma Xulun believes it was connected with the actual casting process.

[^20-6]: Prince Qingji,
son of King Liao of Wu,
had fled to the state of Wei to escape from his father's assassin and successor,
King Helü,
who took the throne of Wu in 514 BCE.

[^20-7]: The text has the *de*,
which means "gain," which may be either an error for the *de* meaning "virtue" or a deliberate play on the two words.
See p.
129,
n.
8.

[^20-8]: Reading *shen* (*zhen* with the heart radical).

[^20-9]: On Prince Bi Gan,
who was put to death by the tyrant Zhou,
see p.
23.
Zhuangzi is presumably explaining why he does not take public office in the troubled times in which he lived.

[^20-10]: The lord of Yan appeared in sec.
14,
p.
111;
he was presumably a sage ruler of antiquity,
identified by some commentators with Shennong.
Some texts give his name as "the lord of Piao."

[^20-11]: Following Wang Niansun's emendation.

[^21-1]: Marquis Wen (r.
424–387 BCE) guided the state of Wei during the crucial years when it first won recognition as an independent feudal domain;
he is famous in history as a patron of learning.
Tian Zifang appears to have been one of the philosophers attracted to his court.

[^21-2]: That melt and turn to mud when the rains come.

[^21-3]: Wenbo Xuezi is vaguely identified as a man of the state of Chu in the south;
hence he refers to the states of Qi and Lu,
the centers of Confucian learning,
as "middle states."

[^21-4]: Compare _Analects_ II,
14: "The gentleman is catholic and not partisan."

[^21-5]: Reading *kong* in place of *tang* in accordance with Ma Xulun's suggestion.

[^21-6]: This beautiful passage,
whose exact meaning I only dimly follow,
presents numerous difficulties of interpretation.
The verb *fu*,
which I have translated as "serve," may be taken in many different ways.

[^21-7]: Following Zhang Binglin's interpretation.

[^21-8]: Ordinarily,
the yang principle represents heaven,
and the yin principle,
earth.
Whether the reversal of their roles here is deliberate or the result of textual error,
I do not know.
Waley (_Three Ways of Thought_,
p.
16) emends the text to put them in their usual order.

[^21-9]: One may also,
like Guo Xiang,
take the word *jie* (understand) to mean "free";
that is,
"He who practices the Way is freed from all this." Compare sec.
6,
p.
48: "the freeing of the bound."

[^21-10]: Boli Xi,
a statesman of the seventh century BCE,
was taken captive when his state was overthrown and,
for a time,
led the life of a lowly cattle tender.
His worth was eventually recognized by Duke Mu of Qin,
who made him his high minister.

[^21-11]: Shun's parents and younger brother made several attempts to kill him,
but he did not allow this to alter his filial behavior.

[^21-12]: Following Ma Xulun's emendation.
It is not clear just what kind of paintings the ruler of Song is commissioning,
and some commentators take them to be mere maps.
But the description of the "true artist" that follows suggests a more creative type of activity.

[^21-13]: King Wen,
honored as the founder of the Zhou dynasty,
was one of the ancient sages most often and extravagantly praised by Confucius and his followers.

[^21-14]: The term "identifying with one's superior" is taken from the teachings of Mozi.
According to this doctrine,
