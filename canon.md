_**Nanhua zhenjing**_ 南華眞經

5 juan

Attributed to Zhuang Zhou 莊周
(second half of the fourth century B.C.)
and his followers

670 (fasc. 349-351)

"True Canon of the Southern Florescence."
This is an unannotated edition of the *Zhuangzi*,
under the canonical title bestowed on it by Emperor Xuanzong in 742.
This edition is part of a series,
comprising also the
_Guanyin zi_ (_667 Wushang miaodao wenshi zhenjing_),
the _Liezi_ (_668 Chongxu zhide zhenjing_),
and the _Gengsang zi_ (_669 Dongling zhenging_).
Each of these editions has a preface
and a portrait of the sage in question.
The origin of this small collection
of the four Taoist authors canonized by Xuanzong is unknown.
Sparse indications in the different prefaces
make it appear later than the Song period.
The preface of the present _Nanhua zhenjing_
is mostly abstracted from Zhuang Zhou's biography in the _Shiji_.
The division into five juan does not respect
the arrangement into inner, outer, and miscellaneous chapters.

Zhuang Zhou was a southerner,
that is, he came from the region south of the Yellow River.
His native place, according to the sparse information we have
from the _Shiji_ and a few other records,
appears to have been the township of Meng,
a place near the present town of Shangqiu in Henan province,
in a region at the intersection of Shandong, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces.
It was part of the ancient state of Song,
and Zhuang Zhou is often referred to as a man of Song.
After the fall of Song in 286 B.C.,
the region fell into the hands of other principalities, including Chu.
As a result, Zhuang Zhou is also known as a native of Chu.

The dates of Zhuang Zhou are tentative,
but most scholars agree with the affirmation in the _Shiji_
that he lived during the times of
King Hui 惠 of Wei 魏 (r. ca. 369-325).
He was also invited to the court of
King Wei 威 of Chu 楚 (r. ca. 339-328).
The exact dates of these Kings are still under discussion,
but *grosso modo* this means that Zhuang Zhou
was active during the second half of the fourth century.
Liu Xiaogan gives his dates tentatively as 369-286 B.C.
(Liu, _Classifying the Zhuangzi chapters_, 41)
which would make Zhuang Zhou a contemporary of
Mengzi 孟子 (tentative dates 372-289).

According to the _Shiji_, the book of Zhuangzi
amounted to more than 100,000 characters.
The _Han shu_, "Yiwen zhi," 30.1730 lists the _Zhuangzi_
as having fifty-two chapters (*pian* 篇),
comprising seven inner, twenty-eight outer, fourteen miscellaneous,
and three additional chapters with "explanations" (jieshuo 解說).
The present edition of the _Zhuangzi_ has only 70,000 characters,
and the outer and miscellaneous chapters number,
respectively, fifteen and eleven;
no trace remains of the "explanations."
The _Shiji_ mentions explicitly
the chapters "Youfu," "Daozhi," and "Quqie,"
which occupy today the position of
chapters 31, 29 (miscellaneous chapters, *zapian* 雜篇)
and 10 (outer chapters, *waipian* 外篇).

Guo Xiang (d. 312) is generally regarded
as the editor of today's version in thirty-three chapters.
According to his preface (see Guo Qingfan, _Zhuangzi jishi_),
he considered sizeable parts of the work spurious or superfluous
and therefore discarded them.
Problematically, virtually none of the discarded texts
have survived elsewhere.

There is a general consensus for ascribing
the seven so-called inner chapters (*neipian* 內篇) to the author.
These stand apart from the others in language, style, and vocabulary.
They also have distinct three-character titles,
enunciating what may be considered to be their main themes
(e.g., "Xiaoyao you," Free and easy wandering),
whereas the other chapters (with the exception of chapters 28 to 31)
are simply named after their opening words.
The distinctiveness and comparatively earlier date for the inner chapters
have been demonstrated by Liu Xiaogan.
Liu's arguments are based on the vocabulary of the inner chapters
and on the more circumstantial, but evident, fact
that much of the text in the other chapters
consists of explanations and developments of writings
contained in the inner chapters.

The dating of the outer and miscellaneous chapters is far more problematic.
The general opinion, notably voiced by Graham,
is that they come from different periods,
the latest, such as the "Tianxia" chapter (33)
being early Han (206 B.C.-A.D. 220).
Some sets of chapters, such as the above-mentioned series of 28 to 31,
are distinguished by thematic, two-character titles.
Graham thinks these chapters come from a different school of thought,
that of the hedonist Yang Zhu 楊朱.
Liu Xiaogan considers such an assumption unnecessary.
The book of Zhuangzi is quoted extensively in
the _Lüshi chunqiu_ 呂氏春秋 (compiled ca. 239 B.C.),
in such a way that suggests it had found its definitive shape by that time.

In spite of the long period during which the text of the book was written
(roughly between 340 B.C. and A.D. 240),
there is a great coherence and unity of thought in the entire work,
even if the influence of other schools of thought
is very much in evidence in the later chapters.
These chapters do, however, refer time and again
to passages in the inner chapters,
which does convey the impression
that parts of the outer and miscellaneous chapters
are equally old (this cross-referencing
has inspired Graham to supplement the text of the inner chapters
with excerpts from the others).

We may conclude that the _Zhuangzi_ is the recipient of the writings
of a single tradition, that it was constitutive of the way of thought
that later came to be called Taoist and
that the older and the newer parts together
are representative of the evolution of this thought
during the century that preceded
the hegemony of Legalism and the united empire (third century B.C.).

Taking this into consideration,
we may say that the _Zhuangzi_ displays a marked absence
of political thought, at least in the inner chapters.
This absence contrasts with all contemporary schools,
with the exception of the Logicians (*mingjia* 名家).
The relationship with the latter school is evident,
but also of a controversial nature.
The _Zhuangzi_ is truly philosophical
inasmuch as its object of investigation is human knowledge
and its relationship to cognition in all its forms.
Zhuang Zhou's epistemology goes farther than most observers have noted.
Most striking is his treatment of mythology and religion.
The mythical fish and bird
(the iconography of both is present on Warring States bronzes)
are compared with ordinary animals and found lacking: too cumbersome!
When Laozi sits in meditation with unfastened hair,
this is not in conformity with a ritual prescription,
but "because he had just bathed" and needed to let his hair dry.
Through bodily exercises of the "nurturing life" kind,
old Pengzu 彭祖 lived only 800 years: what a pity!
Humor is Zhuang Zhou's foremost maieutic tool.

The treatment the _Zhuangzi_ gives to logic is most remarkable:
in the famous "Discussion on the Equality of Things,"
the discourse of logic is used to surpass causality
and open the way to total understanding,
which can be reached through intuition or through dream and trance states.
Here Zhuang Zhou proceeds from the background
of what may be called Chinese shamanism toward universal mysticism.
Mystical truth (*zhen* 眞) is innate, familiar yet unknowable.
The opposition between this inward knowledge of the Taoist
and the outward projected knowledge of the shaman---portrayed
respectively as Master Gourd and as Wuxian the great shaman of antiquity,
in the seventh chapter, "Rejoining the Supreme Ruler"---illustrates
this mystical approach to knowledge.
Although the very disciple of Master Gourd finds the two "ways"
difficult to distinguish, the Master confounds the shaman,
because the latter is limited to the phenomenal world,
whereas the Gourd incapacitates the original chaos.
Here the message of the _Zuangzi_ is truly Taoist.

The _Zhuangzi_ is no doubt one of the most penetrating
and beautiful books written in Chinese
and also one of the masterworks of world literature.
Its influence on Chinese culture---and on Far Eastern culture
in general---has been profound,
not only on Taoism but on Confucianism and Buddhism as well.
Having been canonized as a "classic" only in the eighth century,
the _Zhuangzi_ did not suffer from undue exegetical scholasticism:
every reader could approach its message
unencumbered by considerations of orthodoxy,
hence the vast array of different commentaries.
The _Daozang_ of the Ming features more than ten editions of these.

The _Zhuangzi_'s influence on every part of Taoism
has been considerable.
We find allusions to and quotations from the _Zhuangzi_
in early works of Tending Life practices,
in the poems of the _1016 Zhen'gao_,
and in the hymns of the Lingbao canon.
