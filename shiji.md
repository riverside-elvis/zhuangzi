Chuang-tzu 莊子 was a native of Meng 蒙.[^shiji-22]
His *praenomen* was Chou 周.
Chou once served as a functionary at Ch'i-yüan 漆園 in Meng.[^shiji-23]
He was a contemporary of King Hui 惠 of Liang (r. 370-335 BC)
and King Hsüan 宣 of Ch'i (r. 342-324 BC).
There was nothing into which he in his learning did not enquire,
but in its essentials it went back to the words of Lao-tzu.
Thus his works, over 100,000 characters, in general consisted of allegories.
He wrote "Yü-fu" 漁父 (The Old Fisherman),"
Tao-chih" 盜跖 (Robber Chih),
and "Ch'ü-ch'ieh" 胠箧 (Ransacking Baggage),
in which he mocked the likes of Confucius
and exposed the policies of Lao-tzu.[^shiji-24]
"Keng Sang Tzu" 亢桑子 (Master Keng Sang)
from the Wilderness of Wei-lei 畏累 and the like
were all empty talk without any reality [based] in affairs.[^shiji-25]
Yet he was skilled in composing works and taking speeches apart,
in pointing to one affair and drawing parallels to other cases,
and with this he flayed the Confucians and Mohists.
Even the most profound scholars of the age
could not defend themselves and get away.
His words billowed and swirled,
he followed his own bent to please himself,
and so from kings and dukes down,
the great men could not turn him into their tool.

King Wei 威 of Ch'u (r. 339-329 BC)
heard that Chuang Chou was a worthy man.
He sent a messenger with lavish gifts
to induce him to come and promised him the position of prime minister.
Chuang Chou smiled and told Ch'u's messenger,
"A thousand *chin*[^shiji-26] is great profit,
and a minister or a prime minister are exalted positions,
but can it be that you have not seen
the sacrificial ox used in the suburban sacrifices?
After feeding it for several years,
it is dressed in figured brocade and sent into the Grand Temple.
When things have reached this point,
though it might wish to become a piglet,
how could it attain this?
Go quickly, sir, do not pollute me.
I would rather romp at my own pleasure in a slimy ditch
than be held in captivity by the ruler of a state.
I won't take office for as long as I live,
for that is what pleases my fancy most." [^shiji-27]


[^shiji-22]: According to _Han shu_, 28.1636,
Meng belonged to the Kingdom of Liang
and was a few miles north of modern Shang-ch'iu 商丘 City
in Honan (T'an Ch'i-hsiang, 1:25).
There is, however, an old tradition
that Chuang-tzu came from the state of Song 宋.
See the "So-yin" commentary.
Meng may have belonged to Song first and then to Liang.

[^shiji-23]: According to "Cheng-yi"
the ancient walls of Ch'i-yüan (Lacquer Garden)
were located 17 *li* north of Yüan-chü 冤句 County
in Ts'ao 曹 Prefecture (near modern Tung-ming 東明 in Shantung,
about 50 miles northeast of Kaifeng, [T'an Ch'i-hsiang, 5:45]).

[^shiji-24]: The first two of these chapters,
"The Fisherman" and "The Bandit Chih,"
are probably the chapters Ssu-ma Ch'ien is referring to
when he speaks of "mocking the likes of Confucius."
They include two famous dialogues
in which Confucius is soundly trounced in debate.
"Ransacking Baggage," on the other hand,
is probably what Ssu-ma Ch'ien refers to
when he speaks of "illustrating the policies of Lao-tzu."
In this chapter,
which as A. C. Graham (_Chuang-tzu: The Inner Chapters_
[London: George Allen & Unwin, 1981], p. 209) notes
has parallels with Lao-tzu,
the writer vigorously condemns "lusters after knowledge"
for causing confusion in the world,
with the consequence that instead of remaining settled,
as they used to, people will abandon their homes
in the hope of obtaining better living conditions.
The solution, according to the writer,
is in removing the distractions of ideas and sophistries
from the people's minds.
Graham claims that "The Old Fisherman" and "The Bandit Chih,"
were "Yangist," but thinks "Ransacking Baggage" was "primitivist"
(see his "How Much of the _Chuang-tzu_ Did Chuang-tzu Write?"
in Graham's _Studies in Chinese Philosophy and Philosophical Literature_
[Singapore: The Institute of East Asian Philosophies, 1986], pp. 307-13).

[^shiji-25]: This is probably a reference to chapter 23 of _Chuang-tzu_,
titled "Keng-Sang Ch'u" 庚桑楚 rather than 亢桑.
Keng Sang was "a servant of Lao Tan" 老聃之役,
who "obtained part of the tao of Lao-tzu and resided to the north,
in the mountains of Wei-lei" 偏得老子之道，以北居畏累之山
(_Chuang-tzu_, 23.8a, _SPPY_).
Thus it would seem that Wei-lei is a place name.
"So-yin," however, claims that "Wei-lei hsü"
is the name of a section in _Chuang-tzu_,
and that Wei Lei was a disciple of Lao Tan.
The Chung-hua edition punctuates in accord with this reading.
There is, however, no chapter "Wei Lei"
in any extant edition of _Chuang-tzu_,
and "So-yin" goes on to cite the commentator Ssu-ma Piao 司馬彪 (240-306)
that "Wei-lei is modern Tung-lai 東萊,"
i.e., eastern Shantung province.
Thus at least one early commentator does not share
the opinion expressed in "So-yin."
"Cheng-yi" claims that this passage means Ssu-ma Ch'ien believed
that the "Miscellaneous Chapters" in _Chuang-tzu_
following "Keng-sang Ch'u"
"are all empty theorizing without any true facts."
The point in Ssu-ma Ch'ien's assertion here, however,
is probably a more specific statement of disbelief
in the anecdotes in Chuang-tzu relating to Lao-tzu.

[^shiji-26]: The phrase *ch'ien chin* 千金 (or *pai chin* 百金)
occurs frequently throughout the _Shih chi_.
According to Chao Ch'i's 趙岐 (d. 201 AD)
commentary on the _Mencius_ 2B3 (quoted in Chiao Hsün's 焦循 (1763-1820)
_Meng Tzu cheng-yi_ 孟子正義 [2B3.261, _Hsin-pien chu-tzuchi-ch'eng_]),
in the pre-Ch'in period the word *chin* 金 preceded by a number
indicated so many *yi* 鎰 of bronze or copper;
an *yi* consisted of twenty *liang* 兩.
Gold, on the other hand, is usually referred to in the _Shih chi_
as *huang-chin* 黃金, and is measured in units of *chin* 斤,
which consisted of sixteen *liang*.
In order to avoid confusion between *chin* 金 and *chin* 斤,
we refer to the former as *chin* and the latter as "catties"
(see also "Weights and Measurements" in the front-matter).

[^shiji-27]: There is a short version of this story in _Chuang-tzu_
(32.1062, _Chuang-tzu chi-shih_):
"Someone sent gifts to engage Chuang-tzu.
Chuang-tzu responded to the messenger,
'Have you seen the sacrificial ox, sir?
It is dressed in fine brocades and fed with grass and grain.
When it is led into the Great Temple,
though it might wish to be an untended calf,
how could it attain to it?'"
There are several other variations
on the same theme in the _Chuang-tzu_.
