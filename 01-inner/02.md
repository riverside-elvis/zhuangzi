## 2 齊物論 Discussion on making all things equal

南郭子綦隱几而坐仰天而噓
Ziqi of South Wall sat leaning on his armrest,
staring up at the sky and breathing---
嗒焉似喪其耦
vacant and far away, as though he'd lost his companion.[^2-1]

顏成子游立侍乎前曰
何居乎
Yan Cheng Ziyou, who was standing by his side in attendance, said,
"What is this?

形固可使如槁木而心固可使如死灰乎
Can you really make the body like a withered tree
and the mind like dead ashes?

今之隱几者非昔之隱几者也
The man leaning on the armrest now
is not the one who leaned on it before!"

***

子綦曰
偃不亦善乎而問之也
Ziqi said,
"You do well to ask the question, Yan.

今者吾喪我
Now I have lost myself.

汝知之乎
Do you understand that?

女聞人籟而未聞地籟
You hear the piping of men,
but you haven't heard the piping of earth.

女聞地籟而未聞天籟夫
Or if you've heard the piping of earth,
you haven't heard the piping of Heaven!"

***

子游曰
敢問其方
Ziyou,
"May I venture to ask what this means?"

***

子綦曰
夫大塊噫氣其名為風
Ziqi said,
"The Great Clod belches out breath, and its name is wind.

是唯无作
So long as it doesn't come forth,
nothing happens.

作則萬竅怒呺
But when it does,
then ten thousand hollows begin crying wildly.

而獨不聞之翏翏乎
Can't you hear them, long drawn out?

山林之畏佳
大木百圍之竅穴
似鼻似口似耳
似枅似圈似臼
似洼者似污者
In the mountain forests that lash and sway,
there are huge trees a hundred spans around
with hollows and openings
like noses, like mouths, like ears,
like jugs, like cups, like mortars,
like rifts, like ruts.

激者謞者
叱者吸者
叫者譹者
宎者咬者
前者唱于而隨者唱喁
They roar like waves, whistle like arrows,
screech, gasp,
cry, wail,
moan, and howl,
those in the lead calling out *yeee!*,
those behind calling out *yuuu!*

泠風則小和
飄風則大和
In a gentle breeze they answer faintly,
but in a full gale the chorus is gigantic.

厲風濟則眾竅為虛
And when the fierce wind has passed on,
then all the hollows are empty again.

而獨不見之調調之刁刁乎
Have you never seen the tossing and trembling that goes on?"

***

子游曰
地籟則眾竅是已
人籟則比竹是已
Ziyou said,
"By the piping of earth, then,
you mean simply [the sound of] these hollows,
and by the piping of man,
[the sound of] flutes and whistles.

敢問天籟
But may I ask about the piping of Heaven?"

***

子綦曰
夫吹萬不同而使其自已也
Ziqi said,
"Blowing on the ten thousand things in a different way,
so that each can be itself---
咸其自取怒者其誰邪
all take what they want for themselves,
but who does the sounding?" [^2-2]

***

大知閑閑
Great understanding is broad and unhurried;
小知閒閒
little understanding is cramped and busy.

大言炎炎
Great words are clear and limpid;[^2-3]
小言詹詹
little words are shrill and quarrelsome.

其寐也魂交
In sleep, men's spirits go visiting;
其覺也形開
in waking hours, their bodies hustle.

與接為構
With everything they meet they become entangled.

日以心鬭
縵者窖者密者
Day after day they use their minds in strife,
sometimes grandiose,
sometimes sly,
sometimes petty.

小恐惴惴
Their little fears are mean and trembly;
大恐縵縵
their great fears are stunned and overwhelming.

其發若機栝
其司是非之謂也
They bound off like an arrow or a crossbow pellet,
certain that they are the arbiters of right and wrong.

其留如詛盟
其守勝之謂也
They cling to their position
as though they had sworn before the gods,
sure that they are holding on to victory.
其殺如秋冬
They fade like fall and winter---
以言其日消也
such is the way they dwindle day by day.

其溺之所為之
They drown in what they do---
不可使復之也
you cannot make them turn back.

其厭也如緘以言
They grow dark, as though sealed with seals---
其老洫也
such are the excesses of their old age.

近死之心莫使復陽也
And when their minds draw near to death,
nothing can restore them to the light.

***

喜怒哀樂慮嘆變慹姚佚啟態
Joy, anger, grief, delight,
worry, regret, fickleness, inflexibility,
modesty, willfulness, candor, insolence---
樂出虛
蒸成菌
日夜相代乎前而莫知其所萌
music from empty holes,
mushrooms springing up in dampness,
day and night replacing each other before us,
and no one knows where they sprout from.

已乎
Let it be!

已乎
Let it be!

旦暮得此其所由以生乎
[It is enough that] morning and evening we have them,
and they are the means by which we live.

非彼無我
Without them, we would not exist;
非我無所取
without us, they would have nothing to take hold of.

是亦近矣
This comes close to the matter.

而不知其所為使
But I do not know what makes them the way they are.

若有真宰而特不得其眹
It would seem as though they have some True Master,
and yet I find no trace of him.

可行
He can act---
已信
that is certain.

而不見其形
Yet I cannot see his form.

有情而無形
He has identity but no form.

***

百骸九竅六藏賅而存焉
The hundred joints,
the nine openings,
the six organs,
all come together and exist here [as my body].

吾誰與為親
But which part should I feel closest to?

汝皆說之乎
I should delight in all parts, you say?

其有私焉
But there must be one I ought to favor more.

如是皆有為臣妾乎
If not, are they all of them mere servants?

其臣妾不足以相治乎
But if they all are servants,
then how can they keep order among themselves?

其遞相為君臣乎
Or do they take turns being lord and servant?

其有真君存焉
It would seem as though
there must be some True Lord among them.

如求得其情與不得
無益損乎其真
But whether or not I succeed in discovering his identity,
it neither adds to nor detracts from his Truth.

***

一受其成形不亡以待盡
Once a man receives this fixed bodily form,
he holds on to it, waiting for the end.

與物相刃相靡
其行盡如馳而莫之能止
Sometimes clashing with things, sometimes bending before them,
he runs his course like a galloping steed,
and nothing can stop him.

不亦悲乎
Is he not pathetic?

終身役役而不見其成功
苶然疲役而不知其所歸
Sweating and laboring to the end of his days
and never seeing his accomplishment,
utterly exhausting himself
and never knowing where to look for rest---
可不哀邪
can you help pitying him?

人謂之不死奚益
I'm not dead yet! he says, but what good is that?

其形化其心與之然
His body decays, his mind follows it---
可不謂大哀乎
can you deny that this is a great sorrow?

人之生也固若是芒乎
Man's life has always been a muddle like this.

其我獨芒而人亦有不芒者乎
How could I be the only muddled one,
and other men not muddled?

***

夫隨其成心而師之誰獨且無師乎
If a man follows the mind given him and makes it his teacher,
then who can be without a teacher?

奚必知代而心自取者有之
Why must you comprehend the process of change
and form your mind on that basis before you can have a teacher?

愚者與有焉
Even an idiot has his teacher.

未成乎心而有是非
But to fail to abide by this mind
and still insist on your rights and wrongs---
是今日適越而昔至也
this is like saying that you set off for Yue today
and got there yesterday.[^2-4]

是以無有為有
This is to claim that what doesn't exist exists.

無有為有
雖有神禹且不能知
吾獨且柰何哉
If you claim that what doesn't exist exists,
then even the holy sage Yu couldn't understand you,
much less a person like me!

***

夫言非吹也
Words are not just wind.

言者有言
Words have something to say.

其所言者特未定也果有言邪
But if what they have to say is not fixed,
then do they really say something?

其未嘗有言邪
Or do they say nothing?

其以為異於鷇音
亦有辯乎其無辯乎
People suppose that words are different from
the peeps of baby birds,
but is there any difference, or isn't there?

道惡乎隱而有真偽
What does the Way rely on,[^2-5]
that we have true and false?

言惡乎隱而有是非
What do words rely on,
that we have right and wrong?

道惡乎往而不存
How can the Way go away and not exist?

言惡乎存而不可
How can words exist and not be acceptable?

道隱於小成
言隱於榮華
故有儒墨之是非
When the Way relies on little accomplishments
and words rely on vain show,
then we have the rights and wrongs
of the Confucians and the Mohists.

以是其所非
What one calls right, the other calls wrong;
而非其所是
what one calls wrong, the other calls right.

欲是其所非而非其所是則莫若以明
But if we want to right their wrongs and wrong their rights,
then the best thing to use is clarity.

***

物無非彼
物無非是
Everything has its "that,"
everything has its "this."

自彼則不見
From the point of view of "that," you cannot see it;
自知則知之
but through understanding, you can know it.

故曰
彼出於是
是亦因彼
So I say,
"that" comes out of "this,"
and "this" depends on "that"---
彼是方生之說也
which is to say that "this" and "that"
give birth to each other.

雖然方生方死
But where there is birth,
there must be death;
方死方生
where there is death,
there must be birth.

方可方不可
Where there is acceptability,
there must be unacceptability;
方不可方可
where there is unacceptability,
there must be acceptability.

因是因非
Where there is recognition of right,
there must be recognition of wrong;
因非因是
where there is recognition of wrong,
there must be recognition of right.

是以聖人不由而照之于天
Therefore the sage does not proceed in such a way
but illuminates all in the light of Heaven.[^2-6]

亦因是也是亦彼也彼亦是也
He, too, recognizes a "this" but a "this" that is also "that,"
a "that" that is also "this."

彼亦一是非
His "that" has both a right and a wrong in it;
此亦一是非
his "this," too, has both a right and a wrong in it.

果且有彼是乎哉
So, in fact, does he still have a "this" and "that"?

果且無彼是乎哉
Or does he, in fact, no longer have a "this" and "that"?

彼是莫得其偶謂之道樞
A state in which "this" and "that" no longer find their opposites
is called the hinge of the Way.

樞始得其環中以應無窮
When the hinge is fitted into the socket,
it can respond endlessly.

是亦一無窮
非亦一無窮也
Its right, then, is a single endlessness,
and its wrong, too, is a single endlessness.

故曰
莫若以明
So I say,
the best thing to use is clarity.

***

以指喻指之非指
不若以非指喻指之非指也
To use an attribute to show that attributes are not attributes
is not as good as using a nonattribute to show
that attributes are not attributes.

以馬喻馬之非馬
不若以非馬喻馬之非馬也
To use a horse to show that a horse is not a horse
is not as good as using a non-horse to show
that a horse is not a horse;[^2-7]
天地一指也
Heaven and earth are one attribute;
萬物一馬也
the ten thousand things are one horse.

***

可乎可
What is acceptable we call acceptable;
不可乎不可
what is unacceptable we call unacceptable.

道行之而成
A road is made by people walking on it;
物謂之而然
things are so because they are called so.

惡乎然
What makes them so?

然於然
Making them so makes them so.

惡乎不然
What makes them not so?

不然於不然
Making them not so makes them not so.

物固有所然
Things all must have that which is so;
物固有所可
things all must have that which is acceptable.

無物不然
無物不可
There is nothing that is not so,
nothing that is not acceptable.

***

故為是舉莛與楹
厲與西施
恢恑憰怪
道通為一
For this reason,
whether you point to a little stalk or a great pillar,
a leper or the beautiful Xishi,
things ribald and shady, or things grotesque and strange,
the Way makes them all into one.

其分也成也
Their dividedness is their completeness;
其成也毀也
their completeness is their impairment.

凡物無成與毀復通為一
No thing is either complete or impaired,
but all are made into one again.

唯達者知通為一
Only the man of far-reaching vision
knows how to make them into one.

為是不用而寓諸庸
So he has no use [for categories]
but relegates all to the constant.

庸也者用也
The constant is the useful;
用也者通也
the useful is the passable;
通也者得也
the passable is the successful;
適得而幾矣
and with success, all is accomplished.

因是已已而不知其然
He relies on this alone, relies on it
and does not know he is doing so.

謂之道
This is called the Way.

***

勞神明為一而不知其同也
But to wear out your brain trying to make things into one
without realizing that they are all the same---
謂之朝三
this is called "three in the morning."

何謂朝三
What do I mean by "three in the morning"?

曰狙公賦芧
曰朝三而莫四
When the monkey trainer was handing out acorns, he said,
"You get three in the morning and four at night."

眾狙皆怒
This made all the monkeys furious.

曰然則朝四而莫三
"Well, then," he said,
"you get four in the morning and three at night."

眾狙皆悅
The monkeys all were delighted.

名實未虧而喜怒為用
There was no change in the reality behind the words,
and yet the monkeys responded with joy and anger.

亦因是也
Let them, if they want to.

是以聖人和之以是非而休乎天鈞
So the sage harmonizes with both right and wrong
and rests in Heaven the Equalizer.

是之謂兩行
This is called walking two roads.

***

古之人其知有所至矣
The understanding of the men of ancient times went a long way.

惡乎至
How far did it go?

有以為未始有物者
To the point where some of them believed
that things have never existed---
至矣盡矣不可以加矣
so far, to the end, where nothing can be added.

其次以為有物矣而未始有封也
Those at the next stage thought that things exist
but recognized no boundaries among them.

其次以為有封焉而未始有是非也
Those at the next stage thought there were boundaries
but recognized no right and wrong.

是非之彰也
道之所以虧也
道之所以虧
愛之所以成
Because right and wrong appeared,
the Way was injured,
and because the Way was injured,
love became complete.

果且有成與虧乎哉
果且無成與虧乎哉
But do such things as completion and injury really exist,
or do they not?

***

有成與虧
There is such a thing as completion and injury---
故昭氏之鼓琴也
Mr. Zhao playing the lute is an example.

無成與虧
There is such a thing as no completion and no injury---
故昭氏之不鼓琴也
Mr. Zhao not playing the lute is an example.[^2-8]

昭文之鼓琴也
Zhao Wen played the lute;
師曠之枝策也
Music Master Kuang waved his baton;
惠子之據梧也
Huizi leaned on his desk.

三子之知幾乎
The knowledge of these three was close to perfection.

皆其盛者也故載之末年
All were masters, and therefore their names
have been handed down to later ages.

唯其好之也以異於彼
Only in their likes were they different from him [the true sage].

其好之也欲以明之彼
What they liked, they tried to make clear.

非所明而明之
故以堅白之昧終
What he is not clear about, they tried to make clear,
and so they ended in the foolishness of "hard" and "white." [^2-9]

而其子又以文之綸
終終身無成
Their sons, too, devoted all their lives
to their fathers'[^2-10] theories
but, till their death, never reached any completion.

若是而可謂成乎
Can these men be said to have attained completion?

雖我亦成也
If so, then so have all the rest of us.

若是而不可謂成乎
Or can they not be said to have attained completion?

物與我無成也
If so, then neither we nor anything else has ever attained it.

***

是故滑疑之耀
The torch of chaos and doubt---
聖人之所圖也
this is what the sage steers by.[^2-11]

為是不用而寓諸庸
So he does not use things but relegates all to the constant.

此之謂以明
This is what it means to use clarity.

---

今且有言於此
Now I am going to make a statement here.

不知其與是類乎
I don't know whether or not it fits
into the category of other people's statements.

類與不類相與為類
But whether it fits into their category or whether it doesn't,
it obviously fits into some category.

則與彼無以異矣
So in that respect, it is no different from their statements.

雖然請嘗言之
However, let me try making my statement.

***

有始也者
There is a beginning.

有未始有始也者
There is a not yet beginning to be a beginning.

有未始有夫未始有始也者
There is a not yet beginning to be a not yet beginning
to be a beginning.

有有也者
There is being.

有無也者
There is nonbeing.

有未始有無也者
There is a not yet beginning to be nonbeing.

有未始有夫未始有無也者
There is a not yet beginning to be a not yet beginning
to be nonbeing.

俄而有無矣
Suddenly there is being and nonbeing.

而未知有無之果孰有孰無也
But between this being and nonbeing,
I don't really know which is being and which is nonbeing.

今我則已有謂矣
Now I have just said something.

而未知吾所謂之
其果有謂乎
其果無謂乎
But I don't know whether what I have said
has really said something
or whether it hasn't said something.

***

天下莫大於秋豪之末而大山為小
There is nothing in the world bigger than the tip of an autumn hair,
and Mount Tai is little.

莫壽乎殤子而彭祖為夭
No one has lived longer than a dead child,
and Pengzu died young.[^2-12]

天地與我並生而萬物與我為一
Heaven and earth were born at the same time I was,
and the ten thousand things are one with me.

***

既已為一矣且得有言乎
We have already become one, so how can I say anything?

既已謂之一矣且得無言乎
But I have just *said* that we are one,
so how can I not be saying something?

一與言為二
二與一為三
The one and what I said about it make two,
and two and the original one make three.

自此以往巧歷不能得而況其凡乎
If we go on this way, then even the cleverest mathematician,
much less an ordinary man, can't tell where we'll end.

故自無適有以至於三而況自有適有乎
If by moving from nonbeing to being, we get to three,
how far will we get if we move from being to being?

無適焉因是已
Better not to move but to let things be!

***

夫道未始有封
The Way has never known boundaries;
言未始有常
speech has no constancy.

為是而有畛也
But because of [the recognition of a] "this,"
there came to be boundaries.

請言其畛
Let me tell you what the boundaries are.

有左有右
有倫有義
有分有辯
有競有爭
There is left, there is right,
there are theories, there are debates,[^2-13]
there are divisions, there are discriminations,
there are emulations, and there are contentions.

此之謂八德
These are called the Eight Virtues.[^2-14]

六合之外聖人存而不論
As to what is beyond the Six Realms,[^2-15]
the sage admits it exists but does not theorize.

六合之內聖人論而不議
As to what is within the Six Realms,
he theorizes but does not debate.

春秋經世
先王之志聖人議而不辯
In the case of the _Spring and Autumn_,[^2-16]
the record of the former kings of past ages,
the sage debates but does not discriminate.

故分也者有不分也
So [I say,] those who divide fail to divide;
辯也者有不辯也
those who discriminate fail to discriminate.

曰何也
What does this mean, you ask?

聖人懷之
The sage embraces things.

眾人辯之以相示也
Ordinary men discriminate among them
and parade their discriminations before others.

故曰
辯也者有不見也
So I say,
those who discriminate fail to see.

***

夫大道不稱
The Great Way is not named;
大辯不言
Great Discriminations are not spoken;
大仁不仁
Great Benevolence is not benevolent;
大廉不嗛
Great Modesty is not humble;
大勇不忮
Great Daring does not attack.

道昭而不道
If the Way is made clear, it is not the Way.

言辯而不及
If discriminations are put into words, they do not suffice.

仁常而不成
If benevolence has a constant object, it cannot be universal.[^2-17]

廉清而不信
If modesty is fastidious, it cannot be trusted.

勇忮而不成
If daring attacks, it cannot be complete.

五者园而幾向方矣
These five all are round, but they tend toward the square.[^2-18]

***

故知止其所不知至矣
Therefore understanding that rests in
what it does not understand is the finest.

孰知不言之辯不道之道
Who can understand discriminations that are not spoken,
the Way that is not a way?

若有能知此之謂天府
If he can understand this,
he may be called the Reservoir of Heaven.

注焉而不滿
酌焉而不竭而不知其所由來
Pour into it and it is never full,
dip from it and it never runs dry,
and yet it does not know where the supply comes from.

此之謂葆光
This is called the Shaded Light.[^2-19]

***

故昔者堯問於舜曰
我欲伐宗膾胥敖
So it is that long ago Yao said to Shun,
"I want to attack the rulers of Zong, Kuai, and Xuao.

南面而不釋然
Even as I sit on my throne, this thought nags at me.

其故何也
Why is this?"

***

舜曰
夫三子者猶存乎蓬艾之間
Shun replied,
"These three rulers are only
little dwellers in the weeds and brush.

若不釋然何哉
Why this nagging desire?

昔者十日並出萬物皆照
Long ago, ten suns came out all at once,
and the ten thousand things were all lighted up.

而況德之進乎日者乎
And how much greater is virtue[^2-20] than these suns!"

---

齧缺問乎王倪曰
子知物之所同是乎
Nie Que asked Wang Ni,
"Do you know what all things agree in calling right?"

***

曰吾惡乎知之
"How would I know that?" said Wang Ni.

***

子知子之所不知邪
"Do you know that you don't know it?"

***

曰吾惡乎知之
"How would I know that?"

***

然則物無知邪
"Then do things know nothing?"

***

曰吾惡乎知之
"How would I know that?

雖然嘗試言之
However, suppose I try saying something.

庸詎知吾所謂知之非不知邪
What way do I have of knowing
that if I say I know something
I don't really not know it?

庸詎知吾所謂不知之非知邪
Or what way do I have of knowing
that if I say I don't know something
I don't really in fact know it?

且吾嘗試問乎女
Now let me ask *you* some questions.

民溼寢則腰疾偏死
鰌然乎哉
If a man sleeps in a damp place,
his back aches and he ends up half paralyzed,
but is this true of a loach?

木處則惴慄恂懼
猨猴然乎哉
If he lives in a tree,
he is terrified and shakes with fright,
but is this true of a monkey?

三者孰知正處
Of these three creatures, then,
which one knows the proper place to live?

民食芻豢
麋鹿食薦
蝍且甘帶
鴟鴉耆鼠
Men eat the flesh of grass-fed and grain-fed animals,
deer eat grass,
centipedes find snakes tasty,
and hawks and falcons relish mice.

四者孰知正味
Of these four, which knows how food ought to taste?

猨猵狙以為雌
麋與鹿交
鰌與魚游
Monkeys pair with monkeys,
deer go out with deer,
and fish play around with fish.

毛嬙麗姬人之所美也
Men claim that Maoqiang and Lady Li were beautiful;
魚見之深入
but if fish saw them,
they would dive to the bottom of the stream;
鳥見之高飛
if birds saw them, they would fly away;
麋鹿見之決驟
and if deer saw them, they would break into a run.

四者孰知天下之正色哉
Of these four, which knows
how to fix the standard of beauty for the world?

自我觀之
仁義之端
是非之塗
樊然殽亂
The way I see it,
the rules of benevolence and righteousness
and the paths of right and wrong
all are hopelessly snarled and jumbled.

吾惡能知其辯
How could I know anything
about such discriminations?"

***

齧缺曰
子不知利害則至人固不知利害乎
Nie Que said,
"If you don't know what is profitable or harmful,
then does the Perfect Man likewise know nothing of such things?"

***

王倪曰
至人神矣
Wang Ni replied,
"The Perfect Man is godlike.

大澤焚而不能熱
Though the great swamps blaze, they cannot burn him;
河漢沍而不能寒
though the great rivers freeze, they cannot chill him;
疾雷破山風振海而不能驚
though swift lightning splits the hills
and howling gales shake the sea, they cannot frighten him.

若然者乘雲氣
騎日月而遊乎四海之外
A man like this rides the clouds and mist,
straddles the sun and moon,
and wanders beyond the four seas.

死生无變於己而況利害之端乎
Even life and death have no effect on him,
much less the rules of profit and loss!"

---

瞿鵲子問乎長梧子曰
吾聞諸夫子
聖人不從事於務
不就利不違害
不喜求不緣道
无謂有謂有謂无謂
而遊乎塵垢之外
Ju Que said to Zhang Wuzi,
"I have heard Confucius say that
the sage does not work at anything,
does not pursue profit, does not dodge harm,
does not enjoy being sought after, does not follow the Way,
says nothing yet says something, says something yet says nothing,
and wanders beyond the dust and grime.

夫子以為孟浪之言
而我以為妙道之行也
Confucius himself regarded these as wild and flippant words,
though I believe they describe the working of the mysterious Way.
吾子以為奚若
What do you think of them?"

***

長梧子曰
是黃帝之所聽熒也
而丘也何足以知之
Zhang Wuzi said,
"Even the Yellow Emperor
would be confused if he heard such words,
so how could you expect Confucius to understand them?

且女亦大早計
What's more, you're too hasty in your own appraisal.

見卵而求時夜
見彈而求鴞炙
You see an egg and demand a crowing cock,
see a crossbow pellet and demand a roast dove.

予嘗為女妄言之女以妄聽之
I'm going to try speaking some reckless words,
and I want you to listen to them recklessly.

奚
How will that be?

旁日月
挾宇宙
為其脗合
置其滑涽
以隸相尊
The sage leans on the sun and moon,
tucks the universe under his arm,
merges himself with things,
leaves the confusion and muddle as it is,
and looks on slaves as exalted.

眾人役役
Ordinary men strain and struggle;
聖人愚芚
the sage is stupid and blockish.

參萬歲而一成純
He takes part in ten thousand ages
and achieves simplicity in oneness.

萬物盡然而以是相蘊
For him, all the ten thousand things are what they are,
and thus they enfold one another.

***

予惡乎知說生之非惑邪
"How do I know that loving life is not a delusion?

予惡乎知惡死之非弱喪而不知歸者邪
How do I know that in hating death I am not like a man who,
having left home in his youth, has forgotten the way back?

***

麗之姬艾封人之子也
"Lady Li was the daughter of the border guard of Ai.[^2-21]

晉國之始得之也涕泣沾襟
When she was first taken captive and brought to the state of Jin,
she wept until her tears drenched the collar of her robe.

及其至於王所與王同筐床
食芻豢而後悔其泣也
But later, when she went to live in the palace of the ruler,
shared his couch with him,
and ate the delicious meats of his table,
she wondered why she had ever wept.

予惡乎知夫死者不悔其始之蘄生乎
How do I know that the dead do not wonder
why they ever longed for life?

***

夢飲酒者旦而哭泣
"He who dreams of drinking wine may weep when morning comes;
夢哭泣者旦而田獵
he who dreams of weeping may in the morning go off to hunt.

方其夢也不知其夢也
夢之中又占其夢焉
While he is dreaming, he does not know it is a dream,
and in his dream, he may even try to interpret a dream.

覺而後知其夢也
Only after he wakes does he know it was a dream.

且有大覺而後知此其大夢也
And someday there will be a great awakening
when we know that this is all a great dream.

而愚者自以為覺竊竊然知之
君乎牧乎
Yet the stupid believe they are awake,
busily and brightly assuming they understand things,
calling this man ruler, that one herdsman---
固哉
how dense!

丘也與女皆夢也
Confucius and you both are dreaming!

予謂女夢亦夢也
And when I say you are dreaming, I am dreaming, too.

是其言也其名為弔詭
Words like these will be labeled the Supreme Swindle.

萬世之後而一遇大聖知其解者
是旦暮遇之也
Yet after ten thousand generations,
a great sage may appear who will know their meaning,
and it will still be as though he appeared with astonishing speed.

***

既使我與若辯矣
"Suppose you and I have had an argument.

若勝我我不若勝
若果是也我果非也邪
If you have beaten me instead of my beating you,
then are you necessarily right, and am I necessarily wrong?

我勝若若不吾勝
我果是也而果非也邪
If I have beaten you instead of your beating me,
then am I necessarily right, and are you necessarily wrong?

其或是也
其或非也邪
Is one of us right and the other wrong?

其俱是也
其俱非也邪
Are both of us right, or are both of us wrong?

我與若不能相知也則人固受其黮闇
If you and I don't know the answer,
then other people are bound to be even more in the dark.

吾誰使正之
Whom shall we get to decide what is right?

使同乎若者正之
Shall we get someone who agrees with you to decide?

既與若同矣惡能正之
But if he already agrees with you, how can he decide fairly?

使同乎我者正之
Shall we get someone who agrees with me?

既同乎我矣惡能正之
But if he already agrees with me, how can he decide?

使異乎我與若者正之
Shall we get someone who disagrees with both of us?

既異乎我與若矣惡能正之
But if he already disagrees with both of us, how can he decide?

使同乎我與若者正之
Shall we get someone who agrees with both of us?

既同乎我與若矣惡能正之
But if he already agrees with both of us, how can he decide?

然則我與若與人俱不能相知也
Obviously, then, neither you nor I
nor anyone else can know the answer.

而待彼也邪
Shall we wait for still another person?

***

何化聲之相待若其不相待
"But waiting for one shifting voice [to pass judgment on] another
is the same as waiting for none of them.[^2-22]

和之以天倪
因之以曼衍
所以窮年也
Harmonize them all with the Heavenly Equality,
leave them to their endless changes, and so live out your years.

謂和之以天倪
What do I mean by harmonizing them with the Heavenly Equality?

曰是不是
Right is not right;
然不然
so is not so.

是若果是也則是之異乎不是也亦無辯
If right were really right,
it would differ so clearly from not right
that there would be no need for argument.

然若果然也則然之異乎不然也亦無辯
If so were really so,
it would differ so clearly from not so
that there would be no need for argument.

忘年忘義
Forget the years;
振於無竟
forget distinctions.

故寓諸無竟
Leap into the boundless and make it your home!"

罔兩問景曰
曩子行今子止
Penumbra said to Shadow,
"A little while ago you were walking,
and now you're standing still;
曩子坐今子起
a little while ago you were sitting,
and now you're standing up.

何其無特操與
Why this lack of independent action?"

***

景曰
吾有待而然者邪
Shadow said,
"Do I have to wait for something before I can be like this?

吾所待又有待而然者邪
Does what I wait for also have to wait for something
before it can be like this?

吾待蛇蚹蜩翼邪
Am I waiting for the scales of a snake
or the wings of a cicada?[^2-23]

惡識所以然
How do I know why it is so?

惡識所以不然
How do I know why it isn't so?"

昔者莊周夢為胡蝶
栩栩然胡蝶也自喻適志與
Once Zhuang Zhou dreamed he was a butterfly,
a butterfly flitting and fluttering around,
happy with himself and doing as he pleased.

不知周也
He didn't know he was Zhuang Zhou.

俄然覺則蘧蘧然周也
Suddenly he woke up, and there he was,
solid and unmistakable Zhuang Zhou.

不知周之夢為胡蝶與
胡蝶之夢為周與
But he didn't know if he were Zhuang Zhou
who had dreamed he was a butterfly
or a butterfly dreaming he was Zhuang Zhou.

周與胡蝶則必有分矣
Between Zhuang Zhou and a butterfly,
there must be *some* distinction!

此之謂物化
This is called the Transformation of Things.
