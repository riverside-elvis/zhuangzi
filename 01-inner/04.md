## 4 人間世 In the world of men

顏回見仲尼請行
Yan Hui went to see Confucius
and asked permission to take a trip.[^4-1]

***

曰奚之
"Where are you going?"

***

曰將之衛
"I'm going to Wei."

***

曰奚為焉
"What will you do there?"

***

曰回聞衛君其年壯
"I have heard that the ruler of Wei is very young.

其行獨輕用其國而不見其過
He acts in an independent manner,
thinks little of how he rules his state,
and fails to see his faults.

輕用民死
死者以國量乎澤若蕉
It is nothing to him to lead his people into peril,
and his dead are reckoned by swampfuls like so much grass.[^4-2]

民其无如矣
His people have nowhere to turn.

回嘗聞之夫子曰
治國去之
亂國就之
I have heard you say, Master,
'Leave the state that is well ordered
and go to the state in chaos!

醫門多疾
At the doctor's gate are many sick men.'

願以所聞思其則
I want to use these words as my standard,
庶幾其國有瘳乎
in hopes that I can restore his state to health."

***

仲尼曰譆
若殆往而刑耳
"Ah," said Confucius,
"you will probably go and get yourself executed, that's all.

夫道不欲雜
The Way doesn't want things mixed in with it.

雜則多
When it becomes a mixture, it becomes many ways;
多則擾
with many ways, there is a lot of bustle;
擾則憂
and where there is a lot of bustle, there is trouble---
憂而不救
trouble that has no remedy!

古之至人先存諸己而後存諸人
The Perfect Man of ancient times
made sure that he had it in himself
before he tried to give it to others.

所存於己者未定
何暇至於暴人之所行
When you're not even sure what you've got in yourself,
how do you have time to bother about what some tyrant is doing?

***

且若亦知
夫德之所蕩而知之所為出乎哉
"Do you know
what it is that destroys virtue
and where wisdom comes from?

德蕩乎名
知出乎爭
Virtue is destroyed by fame,
and wisdom comes out of wrangling.

名也者相軋也
知也者爭之器也
Fame is something to beat people down with,
and wisdom is a device for wrangling.

二者凶器
Both are evil weapons---
非所以盡行也
not the sort of thing to bring you success.

且德厚信矼
未達人氣名聞不爭
未達人心而彊以仁義繩墨之言
術暴人之前者
Though your virtue may be great and your good faith unassailable,
if you do not understand men's spirits,
though your fame may be wide and you do not strive with others,
if you do not understand men's minds
but instead appear before a tyrant
and force him to listen to sermons
on benevolence and righteousness, measures and standards---
是以人惡有其美也
this is simply using other men's bad points
to parade your own excellence.

命之曰菑人
You will be called a plaguer of others.

菑人者人必反菑之
He who plagues others will be plagued in turn.

若殆為人菑夫
You will probably be plagued by this man.

***

且苟為悅賢而惡不肖
"And suppose he is the kind who actually delights in worthy men
and hates the unworthy---
惡用而求有以異
then why does he need you to try to make him any different?

若唯无詔
You had best keep your advice to yourself!

王公必將乘人而鬭其捷
Kings and dukes always lord it over others
and fight to win the argument.

而目將熒之
而色將平之
口將營之
容將形之
心且成之
You will find your eyes growing dazed,
your color changing,
your mouth working to invent excuses,
your attitude becoming more and more humble,
until in your mind you end by supporting him.

是以火救火
以水救水
名之曰益多
This is to pile fire on fire,
to add water to water,
and is called 'increasing the excessive.'

順始无窮
If you give in at the beginning, there will be no place to stop.

若殆以不信厚言
必死於暴人之前矣
Since your fervent advice is almost certain not to be believed,
you are bound to die if you come into the presence of a tyrant.

***

且昔者桀殺關龍逢紂殺王子比干
"In ancient times Jie put Guan Longfeng to death,
and Zhou put Prince Bi Gan to death.

是皆脩其身
以下傴拊人之民
以下拂其上者也
Both Guan Longfeng and Prince Bi Gan
were scrupulous in their conduct,
bent down to comfort and aid the common people,
and used their positions as ministers to oppose their superiors.

故其君因其脩以擠之
是好名者也
Therefore their rulers, Jie and Zhou,
utilized their scrupulous conduct as a means to trap them,
for they were too fond of good fame.

昔者
堯攻叢枝胥敖
禹攻有扈
國為虛厲身為刑戮
In ancient times Yao attacked Congzhi and Xuao,
and Yu attacked Youhu,
and these states were left empty and unpeopled,
their rulers cut down.

其用兵不止其求實无已
It was because they employed their armies constantly
and never ceased their search for gain.

是皆求名實者也
All were seekers of fame or gain---
而獨不聞之乎
have you alone not heard of them?

名實者聖人之所不能勝也而況若乎
Even the sages cannot cope with men who are after fame or gain,
much less a person like you!

***

雖然若必有以也
"However, you must have some plan in mind.

嘗以語我來
Come, tell me what it is."

***

顏回曰
端而虛勉而一則可乎
Yan Hui said,
"If I am grave and empty-hearted,
diligent and of one mind, won't that do?"

***

曰惡惡可
"Goodness, how could *that* do?

夫以陽為充孔揚
采色不定常人之所不違
You may put on a fine outward show and seem very impressive,
but you can't avoid having an uncertain look on your face,
anymore than an ordinary man can.[^4-3]

因案人之所感以求容與其心
And then you try to gauge this man's feelings
and seek to influence his mind.

名之曰日漸之德
不成而況大德乎
But with him, what is called
'the virtue that advances a little each day'
would not succeed, much less a great display of virtue!

將執而不化
He will stick fast to his position and never be converted.

外合而內不訾
Though he may make outward signs of agreement,
inwardly he will not give it a thought!

其庸詎可乎
How could such an approach succeed?"

***

然則我內直
而外曲成而上比
"Well then, suppose I am inwardly direct, outwardly compliant,
and do my work through the examples of antiquity?

內直者與天為徒
By being inwardly direct, I can be the companion of Heaven.

與天為徒者知天子之與己皆天之所子
Being a companion of Heaven,
I know that the Son of Heaven and I are equally the sons of Heaven.

而獨以己言
蘄乎而人善之
蘄乎而人不善之邪
Then why would I use my words
to try to get men to praise me
or to try to get them not to praise me?

若然者人謂之童子
A man like this, people call The Child.

是之謂與天為徒
This is what I mean by being a companion of Heaven.

***

外曲者與人之為徒也
"By being outwardly compliant, I can be a companion of men.

擎跽曲拳
Lifting up the tablet, kneeling, bowing, crouching down---
人臣之禮也
this is the etiquette of a minister.

人皆為之吾敢不為邪
Everybody does it, so why shouldn't I?

為人之所為者人亦无疵焉
If I do what other people do, they can hardly criticize me.

是之謂與人為徒
This is what I mean by being a companion of men.

***

成而上比者與古為徒
"By doing my work through the examples of antiquity,
I can be the companion of ancient times.

其言雖教
讁之實也
古之有也
非吾有也
Though my words
may in fact be lessons and reproaches,
they belong to ancient times
and not to me.

若然者雖直不為病
In this way, though I may be blunt, I cannot be blamed.

是之謂與古為徒
This is what I mean by being a companion of antiquity.

若是則可乎
If I go about it in this way, will it do?"

***

仲尼曰
惡惡可
Confucius said,
"Goodness, how could *that* do?

大多政法而不諜
You have too many policies and plans,
and you haven't seen what is needed.

雖固亦无罪
You will probably get off without incurring any blame, yes.

雖然止是耳矣
But that will be as far as it goes.

夫胡可以及化
How do you think you can actually convert him?

猶師心者也
You are still making the mind[^4-4] your teacher!"

***

顏回曰
吾无以進矣
Yan Hui said,
"I have nothing more to offer.

敢問其方
May I ask the proper way?"

***

仲尼曰
齋
"You must fast!"
said Confucius.

吾將語若
"I will tell you what that means.

有而為之其易邪
Do you think it is easy to do anything while you have a mind?

易之者皞天不宜
If you do, Bright Heaven will not sanction you."

***

顏回曰
回之家貧
Yan Hui said,
"My family is poor.

唯不飲酒不茹葷者數月矣
I haven't drunk wine or eaten any strong foods for several months.

若此則可以為齋乎
So can I be considered as having fasted?"

***

曰是祭祀之齋非心齋也
"That is the fasting one does before a sacrifice,
not the fasting of the mind."

***

回曰敢問心齋
"May I ask what the fasting of the mind is?"

***

仲尼曰
若一志
Confucius said,
"Make your will one!

无聽之以耳而聽之以心
Don't listen with your ears, listen with your mind.

无聽之以心而聽之以氣
No, don't listen with your mind, but listen with your spirit.

聽止於耳
心止於符
氣也者虛而待物者也
Listening stops with the ears,
the mind stops with recognition,
but spirit is empty and waits for all things.

唯道集虛
The Way gathers in emptiness alone.

虛者心齋也
Emptiness is the fasting of the mind."

***

顏回曰
回之未始得使實自回也
Yan Hui said,
"Before I heard this, I was certain that I was Hui.

得使之也未始有回也
But now that I have heard it, there is no more Hui.

可謂虛乎
Can this be called emptiness?"

***

夫子曰
盡矣
"That's all there is to it,"
said Confucius.

吾語若
"Now I will tell you.

若能入遊其樊而无感其名
You may go and play in his bird cage but never be moved by fame.

入則鳴
If he listens, then sing;
不入則止
if not, keep still.

无門无毒
一宅而寓於不得已
Have no gate, no opening,[^4-5]
but make oneness your house and live with what cannot be avoided.

則幾矣
Then you will be close to success.

***

絕迹易
"It is easy to keep from walking;
无行地難
the hard thing is to walk without touching the ground.

為人使易以偽
為天使難以偽
It is easy to cheat when you work for men
but hard to cheat when you work for Heaven.

聞以有翼飛者矣
未聞以无翼飛者也
You have heard of flying with wings,
but you have never heard of flying without wings.

聞以有知知者矣
未聞以无知知者也
You have heard of the knowledge that knows,
but you have never heard of the knowledge that does not know.

瞻彼闋者虛室生白
Look into that closed room,
the empty chamber where brightness is born!

吉祥止止
Fortune and blessing gather where there is stillness.

夫且不止
But if you do not keep still---
是之謂坐馳
this is what is called sitting but racing around.[^4-6]

夫徇耳目內通而外於心知
Let your ears and eyes communicate with what is inside
and put mind and knowledge on the outside.

鬼神將來舍而況人乎
Then even gods and spirits will come to dwell,
not to speak of men!

是萬物之化也
禹舜之所紐也
伏戲几蘧之所行終
This is the changing of the ten thousand things,
the bond of Yu and Shun,
the constant practice of Fu Xi and Ji Qu.[^4-7]

而況散焉者乎
How much more should it be a rule for lesser men!"

---

葉公子高將使於齊問於仲尼
Zigao, duke of She,[^4-8]
who was being sent on a mission to Qi,
consulted Confucius.

曰王使諸梁也甚重
"The king is sending me on a very important mission.

齊之待使者蓋將甚敬而不急
Qi will probably treat me with great honor
but will be in no hurry to do anything more.

匹夫猶未可動而況諸侯乎
Even a commoner cannot be forced to act,
much less one of the feudal lords.

吾甚慄之
I am very worried about it.

子常語諸梁也曰
凡事若小若大
寡不道以懽成
You once said to me,
'In all affairs, whether large or small,
there are few men who reach a happy conclusion
except through the Way.

事若不成則必有人道之患
If you do not succeed,
you are bound to suffer from the judgment of men.

事若成則必有陰陽之患
If you do succeed,
you are bound to suffer from the yin and yang.[^4-9]

若成若不成而後無患者
To suffer no harm whether or not you succeed---
唯有德者能之
only the man who has virtue can do that.'

吾食也執粗而不臧
爨無欲清之人
I am a man who eats plain food that is simply cooked,
so that no one ever complains of the heat in my kitchens.[^4-10]

今吾朝受命而夕飲冰
Yet this morning I received my orders from the king
and by evening I am gulping ice water---
我其內熱與
do you suppose I have developed some kind of internal fever?

吾未至乎事之情而既有陰陽之患矣
I have not even gone to Qi to see what the situation is like,
and already I am suffering from the yin and yang.

事若不成必有人道之患
And if I do not succeed,
I am bound to suffer from the judgment of men.

是兩也
I will have both worries.

為人臣者不足以任之
As a minister, I am not capable of carrying out this mission.

子其有以語我來
But perhaps you have some advice you can give me...."

***

仲尼曰
天下有大戒二
Confucius said,
"In the world, there are two great decrees:
其一命也其一義也
one is fate and the other is duty.[^4-11]

子之愛親命也
That a son should love his parents is fate---
不可解於心
you cannot erase this from his heart.

臣之事君義也
That a subject should serve his ruler is duty---
無適而非君也
無所逃於天地之間
there is no place he can go and be without his ruler,
no place he can escape to between heaven and earth.

是之謂大戒
These are called the great decrees.

是以夫事其親者不擇地而安之
Therefore, to serve your parents
and be content to follow them anywhere---
孝之至也
this is the perfection of filial piety.

夫事其君者不擇事而安之
To serve your ruler and be content to do anything for him---
忠之盛也
this is the peak of loyalty.

自事其心者哀樂不易施乎前
And to serve your own mind so that sadness or joy
does not sway or move it;
知其不可奈何而安之若命
to understand what you can do nothing about
and to be content with it as with fate---
德之至也
this is the perfection of virtue.

為人臣子者固有所不得已
As a subject and a son,
you are bound to find things you cannot avoid.

行事之情而忘其身
何暇至於悅生而惡死
If you act in accordance with the state of affairs
and forget about yourself,
then what leisure will you have to love life and hate death?

夫子其行可矣
Act in this way, and you will be all right.

***

丘請復以所聞
"I want to tell you something else I have learned.

凡交近則必相靡以信
In all human relations,
if the two parties are living close to each other,
they may form a bond through personal trust.

遠則必忠之以言
言必或傳之
But if they are far apart,
they must use words to communicate their loyalty,
and words must be transmitted by someone.

夫傳兩喜兩怒之言
天下之難者也
To transmit words that are either pleasing to both parties
or infuriating to both parties
is one of the most difficult things in the world.

夫兩喜必多溢美之言
When both parties are pleased,
there must be some exaggeration of the good points;
兩怒必多溢惡之言
and when both parties are angered,
there must be some exaggeration of the bad points.

凡溢之類妄
Anything that smacks of exaggeration is irresponsible.

妄則其信之也莫
莫則傳言者殃
Where there is irresponsibility,
no one will trust what is said, and when that happens,
the man who is transmitting the words will be in danger.

故法言曰
傳其常情
Therefore the aphorism says,
'Transmit the established facts;
無傳其溢言
do not transmit words of exaggeration.'

則幾乎全
If you do that, you will probably come out all right.

***

且以巧鬥力者
始乎陽
常卒乎陰
大至則多奇巧
"When men get together to pit their strength in games of skill,
they start off in a light and friendly mood
but usually end up in a dark and angry one,
and if they go on too long,
they start resorting to various underhanded tricks.

以禮飲酒者
始乎治
常卒乎亂
When men meet  at some ceremony to drink,
they start off in an orderly manner
but usually end up in disorder;
大至則多奇樂
and if they go on too long,
they start indulging in various irregular amusements.

凡事亦然
It is the same with all things.

始乎諒常卒乎鄙
What starts out being sincere
usually ends up being deceitful.

其作始也簡其將畢也必巨
What was simple in the beginning
acquires monstrous proportions in the end.

***

夫言者風波也
"Words are like wind and waves;
行者實喪也
actions are a matter of gain and loss.

風波易以動
Wind and waves are easily moved;
實喪易以危
questions of gain and loss easily lead to danger.

忿設無由巧言偏辭
Hence anger arises from no other cause
than clever words and one-sided speeches.

獸死不擇音
When animals face death,
they do not care what cries they make;
氣息茀然於是並生心厲
their breath comes in gasps,
and a wild fierceness is born in their hearts.

剋核大至則必有不肖之心應之
而不知其然也
[Men, too,] if you press them too hard,
are bound to answer you with ill-natured hearts,
though they do not know why they do so.

苟為不知其然也孰知其所終
If they themselves do not understand
why they behave like this,
then who knows where it will end?

***

故法言曰
無遷令
"Therefore the aphorism says,
'Do not deviate from your orders;
無勸成
do not press for completion.'

過度益也
To go beyond the limit is excess;
遷令勸成殆事
to deviate from orders or press for completion
is a dangerous thing.

美成在久
A good completion takes a long time;
惡成不及改
a bad completion cannot be changed later.

可不慎與
Can you afford to be careless?

***

且夫乘物以遊心
"Just go along with things and let your mind move freely.

託不得已以養中
Resign yourself to what cannot be avoided
and nourish what is within you---
至矣
this is best.

何作為報也
What more do you have to do to fulfill your mission?

莫若為致命
Nothing is as good as following orders (obeying fate)---
此其難者
that's how difficult it is!" [^4-12]

---

顏闔將傅衛靈公大子而問於蘧伯玉
Yan He, who had been appointed tutor to the crown prince,
son of Duke Ling of Wei, went to consult Ju Boyu.[^4-13]

曰有人於此其德天殺
"Here is this man who by nature is lacking in virtue.

與之為無方則危吾國
If I let him go on with his unruliness, I will endanger the state.

與之為有方則危吾身
If I try to impose some rule on him, I will endanger myself.

其知適足以知人之過而不知其所以過
He knows enough to recognize the faults of others,
but he doesn't know his own faults.

若然者吾奈之何
What can I do with a man like this?"

***

蘧伯玉曰
善哉問乎
"A very good question,"
said Ju Boyu.

戒之
慎之
正汝身也哉
"Be careful,
be on your guard,
and make sure that you yourself are in the right!

形莫若就
心莫若和
In your actions, it is best to follow along with him,
and in your mind, it is best to harmonize with him.

雖然之二者有患
However, these two courses involve certain dangers.

就不欲入
和不欲出
Though you follow along,
you don't want to be pulled into his doings,
and though you harmonize,
you don't want to be drawn out too far.

形就而入
且為顛為滅為崩為蹶
If in your actions you follow along
to the extent of being pulled in with him,
then you will be overthrown, destroyed, wiped out,
and brought to your knees.

心和而出
且為聲為名為妖為孽
If in your mind you harmonize to the extent of being drawn out,
then you will be talked about, named, blamed, and condemned.

彼且為嬰兒
亦與之為嬰兒
If he wants to be a child, be a child with him.

彼且為無町畦
亦與之為無町畦
If he wants to follow erratic ways, follow erratic ways with him.

彼且為無崖
亦與之為無崖
If he wants to be reckless, be reckless with him.

達之入於無疵
Understand him thoroughly,
and lead him to the point where he is without fault.[^4-14]

***

汝不知夫螳蜋乎
怒其臂以當車轍
不知其不勝任也
"Don't you know about the praying mantis
that waved its arms angrily in front of an approaching carriage,
unaware that it was incapable of stopping it?

是其才之美者也
Such was the high opinion it had of its talents.

戒之慎之
Be careful, be on your guard!

積伐而美者以犯之幾矣
If you offend him by parading your store of talents,
you will be in danger!

***

汝不知夫養虎者乎
"Don't you know how the tiger trainer goes about it?

不敢以生物與之為其殺之之怒也
He doesn't dare give the tiger any living thing to eat
for fear it will learn the taste of fury by killing it.

不敢以全物與之為其決之之怒也
He doesn't dare give it any whole thing to eat
for fear it will learn the taste of fury by tearing it apart.

時其飢飽達其怒心
He gauges the state of the tiger's appetite
and thoroughly understands its fierce disposition.

虎之與人異類而媚養己者順也
Tigers are a different breed from men,
and yet you can train them to be gentle with their keepers
by following along with them.

故其殺者逆也
The men who get killed are the ones who go against them.

***

夫愛馬者
以筐盛矢
以蜄盛溺
"The horse lover
uses a fine box to catch the dung
and a giant clam shell to catch the stale.

適有蚉虻僕緣而拊之不時則缺銜毀首碎胸
But if a mosquito or a fly lights on the horse
and he slaps it at the wrong time,
then the horse will break the bit, hurt its head, and bang its chest.

意有所至而愛有所亡
The horse lover tries to think of everything,
but his affection leads him into error.

可不慎邪
Can you afford to be careless?"

匠石之齊至乎曲轅見櫟社樹
Carpenter Shi went to Qi and, when he got to Crooked Shaft,
he saw a serrate oak standing by the village shrine.

其大蔽數千牛絜之百圍其高臨山
It was broad enough to shelter several thousand oxen
and measured a hundred spans around, towering above the hills.

十仞而後有枝其可以為舟者旁十數
The lowest branches were eighty feet from the ground,
and a dozen or so of them could have been made into boats.

觀者如市匠伯不顧遂行不輟
There were so many sightseers that the place looked like a fair,
but the carpenter didn't even glance around
and went on his way without stopping.

弟子厭觀之走及匠石曰
自吾執斧斤以隨夫子
未嘗見材如此其美也
His apprentice stood staring for a long time
and then ran after Carpenter Shi and said,
"Since I first took up my ax and followed you, Master,
I have never seen timber as beautiful as this.

先生不肯視行不輟
But you don't even bother to look,
and go right on without stopping.

何邪
Why is that?"

***

曰已矣
"Forget it---
勿言之矣
say no more!" said the carpenter.

散木也
"It's a worthless tree!

以為舟則沈
Make boats out of it and they'd sink;
以為棺槨則速腐
make coffins and they'd rot in no time;
以為器則速毀
make vessels and they'd break at once.

以為門戶則液樠
Use it for doors and it would sweat sap like pine;
以為柱則蠹
use it for posts and the worms would eat them up.

是不材之木也
It's not a timber tree---
無所可用
there's nothing it can be used for.

故能若是之壽
That's how it got to be that old!"

***

匠石歸櫟社見夢曰
女將惡乎比予哉
若將比予於文木邪
After Carpenter Shi had returned home,
the oak tree appeared to him in a dream and said,
"What are you comparing me with?
Are you comparing me with those useful trees?

夫柤梨橘柚果蓏之屬
The cherry apple, the pear, the orange, the citron,
the rest of those fructiferous trees and shrubs---
實熟則剝剝則辱
as soon as their fruit is ripe,
they are torn apart and subjected to abuse.

大枝折小枝泄
Their big limbs are broken off,
their little limbs are yanked around.

此以其能苦其生者也
故不終其天年而中道夭
Their utility makes life miserable for them,
and so they don't get to finish out the years Heaven gave them
but are cut off in mid-journey.

自掊
They bring it on themselves---
擊於世俗者也
the pulling and tearing of the common mob.

物莫不若是
And it's the same way with all other things.

***

且予求無所可用久矣
幾死乃今得之
"As for me, I've been trying a long time to be of no use,
and though I almost died, I've finally got it.

為予大用
This is of great use to me.

使予也而有用且得有此大也邪
If I had been of some use, would I ever have grown this large?

且也若與予也皆物也
Moreover, you and I are both of us things.

奈何哉
What's the point of this---
其相物也
things condemning things?

而幾死之散人
You, a worthless man about to die---
又惡知散木
how do you know I'm a worthless tree?"

***

匠石覺而診其夢
When Carpenter Shi woke up, he reported his dream.

弟子曰
趣取無用則為社何邪
His apprentice said,
"If it's so intent on being of no use,
what's it doing there at the village shrine?" [^4-15]

***

曰密若無言
"Shhh! Say no more!

彼亦直寄焉
It's only *resting* there.

以為不知己者詬厲也
If we carp and criticize,
it will merely conclude that we don't understand it.

不為社者且幾有翦乎
Even if it weren't at the shrine,
do you suppose it would be cut down?

且也彼其所保與眾異
It protects itself in a different way from ordinary people.

以義譽之不亦遠乎
If you try to judge it by conventional standards,
you'll be way off!"

南伯子綦遊乎商之丘
見大木焉有異
Ziqi of Nanbo was wandering around the Hill of Shang
when he saw a huge tree there, different from all the rest.

結駟千乘隱將芘其所藾
A thousand teams of horses could have taken shelter under it,
and its shade would have covered them all.

子綦曰
此何木也哉
此必有異材夫
Ziqi said,
"What tree is this?
It must certainly have some extraordinary usefulness!"

仰而視其細枝則拳曲而不可以為棟梁
俯而見其大根則軸解而不可為棺槨
But looking up, he saw that the smaller limbs
were gnarled and twisted, unfit for beams or rafters,
and looking down, he saw that the trunk
was pitted and rotten and could not be used for coffins.

咶其葉則口爛而為傷
He licked one of the leaves,
and it blistered his mouth and made it sore.

嗅之則使人狂酲三日而不已
He sniffed the odor,
and it was enough to make a man drunk for three days.

子綦曰
此果不材之木也
以至於此其大也
"It turns out to be a completely unusable tree,"
said Ziqi,
"and so it has been able to grow this big.

嗟乎
Aha!---

神人以此不材
it is this unusableness that the Holy Man makes use of!"

宋有荊氏者宜楸柏桑
The region of Jingshi in Song
is fine for growing catalpas, cypresses, and mulberries.

其拱把而上者
求狙猴之杙者斬之
But those that are more than one or two arm lengths around
are cut down for people who want monkey perches;
三圍四圍
求高名之麗者斬之
those that are three or four spans around
are cut down for the ridgepoles of tall roofs;[^4-16]

七圍八圍
貴人富商之家求樿傍者斬之
and those that are seven or eight spans
are cut down for the families of nobles or rich merchants
who want side boards for coffins.

故未終其天年而中道已夭於斧斤
So they never get to live out the years Heaven gave them
but are cut down in mid-journey by axes.

此材之患也
This is the danger of being usable.

故解之以
牛之白顙者
與豚之亢鼻者
與人有痔病者
不可以適河
In the Jie sacrifice,[^4-17]
oxen with white foreheads,
pigs with turned-up snouts,
and men with piles
cannot be offered to the river.

此皆巫祝以知之矣所以為不祥也
This is something all the shamans know,
and hence they consider them inauspicious creatures.

此乃神人之所以為大祥也
But the Holy Man, for the same reason,
considers them highly auspicious.

支離疏者
There's Crippled Shu---
頤隱於臍
肩高於頂
會撮指天
五管在上
兩髀為脅
chin stuck down in his navel,
shoulders up above his head,
pigtail pointing at the sky,
his five organs on the top,
his two thighs pressing his ribs.

挫鍼治繲足以餬口
By sewing and washing, he gets enough to fill his mouth;
鼓筴播精足以食十人
by handling a winnow and sifting out the good grain,
he makes enough to feed ten people.

上徵武士則支離攘臂而遊於其間
When the authorities call out the troops,
he stands in the crowd waving goodbye;
上有大役則支離以有常疾不受功
when they get up a big work party,
they pass him over because he's a chronic invalid.

上與病者粟則受三鐘與十束薪
And when they are doling out grain to the ailing,
he gets three big measures and ten bundles of firewood.

夫支離其形者
猶足以養其身
終其天年
With a crippled body,
he's still able to look after himself
and finish out the years Heaven gave him.

又況支離其德者乎
How much better, then, if he had crippled virtue!

孔子適楚楚狂接輿遊其門曰
鳳兮鳳兮何如德之衰也
When Confucius visited Chu,
Jie Yu, the madman of Chu, wandered by his gate crying,
"Phoenix, phoenix, how has virtue failed!

來世不可待
The future you cannot wait for;
往世不可追也
the past you cannot pursue.

天下有道聖人成焉
When the world has the Way, the sage succeeds;
天下無道聖人生焉
when the world is without the Way, the sage survives.

方今之時僅免刑焉
In times like the present, we do well to escape penalty.

福輕乎羽莫之知載
Good fortune is as light as a feather,
but nobody knows how to pick it up.

禍重乎地莫之知避
Misfortune is as heavy as the earth,
but nobody knows how to stay out of its way.

已乎已乎
Leave off, leave off---
臨人以德
this teaching men virtue!

殆乎殆乎
Dangerous, dangerous---
畫地而趨
to mark off the ground and run!

迷陽迷陽
Fool, fool---
無傷吾行
don't spoil my walking!

吾行卻曲
I walk a crooked way---
無傷吾足
don't step on my feet.

山木自寇也
The mountain trees do themselves harm;
膏火自煎也
the grease in the torch burns itself up.

桂可食故伐之
The cinnamon can be eaten, and so it gets cut down;
漆可用故割之
the lacquer tree can be used, and so it gets hacked apart.

人皆知有用之用而莫知無用之用也
All men know the use of the useful,
but nobody knows the use of the useless!" [^4-18]
