齧缺因躍而大喜行以告蒲衣子
Nie Que proceeded to hop around in great glee
and went and told Master Puyi.

蒲衣子曰
而乃今知之乎
Master Puyi said,
"Are you just now finding *that* out?[^7-1]

有虞氏不及泰氏
The clansman Youyu was no match for the clansman Tai.[^7-2]

有虞氏其猶藏仁以要人
The clansman Youyu still held on to benevolence
and worked to win men over.

亦得人矣而未始出於非人
He won men over all right,
but he never got out into [the realm of] 'notman.'

泰氏
The clansman Tai, now---
其臥徐徐
he lay down peaceful and easy;
其覺于于
he woke up wide-eyed and blank.

一以己為馬
Sometimes he thought he was a horse;
一以己為牛
sometimes he thought he was a cow.

其知情信
His understanding was truly trustworthy;
其德甚真
his virtue was perfectly true.

而未始入於非人
He never entered [the realm of] 'non-man.'" [^7-3]

肩吾見狂接輿
Jian Wu went to see the madman Jie Yu.

狂接輿曰
日中始何以語女
Jie Yu said,
"What was Zhong Shi telling you the other day?" [^7-4]

***

肩吾曰
告我君人者
以己出經式義度
人孰敢不聽而化諸
Jian Wu said,
"He told me that the ruler of men should devise his own
principles, standards, ceremonies, and regulations,
and then there will be no one who will fail to obey him
and be transformed by them."

***

狂接輿曰
是欺德也
The madman Jie Yu said,
"This is bogus virtue!

其於治天下也
猶涉海鑿河而使蚉負山也
To try to govern the world like this
is like trying to walk the ocean, to drill through a river,
or to make a mosquito shoulder a mountain!

夫聖人之治也治外乎
When the sage governs, does he govern what is on the *outside*?

正而後行
He makes sure of himself first, and then he acts.

確乎能其事者而已矣
He makes absolutely certain
that things can do what they are supposed to do,
that is all.

且鳥高飛
以避矰弋之害
The bird flies high in the sky
where it can escape the danger of stringed arrows.

鼷鼠深穴乎神丘之下
以避熏鑿之患
The field mouse burrows deep down under the sacred hill
where it won't have to worry about men digging and smoking it out.

而曾二蟲之無知
Have you got less sense than these two little creatures?"

---

天根遊於殷陽
Tian Gen was wandering on the sunny side of Yin Mountain.

至蓼水之上適遭無名人
When he reached the banks of the Liao River,
he happened to meet a Nameless Man.

而問焉曰
請問為天下
He questioned the man, saying,
"Please may I ask how to rule the world?"

***

無名人曰
去汝鄙人也
The Nameless Man said,
"Get away from me, you peasant!

何問之不豫也
What kind of a dreary question is that!

予方將與造物者為人
I'm just about to set off with the Creator.

厭則又
乘夫莽眇之鳥
以出六極之外而遊無何有之鄉
以處壙埌之野
And if I get bored with that,
then I'll ride on the Light-and-Lissome Bird
out beyond the six directions,
wandering in the village of Not-Even-Anything
and living in the Broad-and-Borderless field.

汝又何帠以治天下感予之心為
What business[^7-5] do you have coming
with this talk of governing the world
and disturbing my mind?"

***

又復問
But Tian Gen repeated his question.

無名人曰
汝遊心於淡
合氣於漠
順物自然而無容私焉
The Nameless Man said,
"Let your mind wander in simplicity,
blend your spirit with the vastness,
follow along with things the way they are,
and make no room for personal views---
而天下治矣
then the world will be governed."

陽子居見老聃曰
有人於此
嚮疾強梁
物徹疏明
學道不倦
Yangzi Ju[^7-6] went to see Lao Dan and said,
"Here is a man
swift as an echo, strong as a beam,
with a wonderfully clear understanding of the principles of things,
studying the Way without ever letting up---
如是者可比明王乎
a man like this could compare
with an enlightened king, couldn't he?"

***

老聃曰
是於聖人也
胥易技係
勞形怵心者也
Lao Dan said,
"In comparison with the sage, a man like this
is a drudging slave, a craftsman bound to his calling,
wearing out his body, grieving his mind.

且也
虎豹之文來田
猿狙之便
執嫠之狗來藉
They say
it is the beautiful markings of the tiger and the leopard
that call out the hunters,
the nimbleness of the monkey
and the ability of the dog to catch rats[^7-7]
that make them end up chained.

如是者
A man like this---
可比明王乎
how could he compare with an enlightened king?"

***

陽子居蹴然曰
敢問明王之治
Yangzi Ju, much taken aback, said,
"May I venture to ask about the government
of the enlightened king?"

***

老聃曰
明王之治
Lao Dan said,
"The government of the enlightened king?

功蓋天下而似不自己
His achievements blanket the world
but appear not to be his own doing.

化貸萬物而民弗恃
His transforming influence touches the ten thousand things,
but the people do not depend on him.

有莫舉名
With him there is no promotion or praise---
使物自喜
he lets everything find its own enjoyment.

立乎不測而遊於無有者也
He takes his stand on what cannot be fathomed
and wanders where there is nothing at all."

鄭有神巫曰季咸
In Zheng there was a shaman of the gods named Ji Xian.

知人之
生死存亡
禍福壽夭
期以歲月旬日若神
He could tell whether men would
live or die, survive or perish,
be fortunate or unfortunate, live a long time or die young,
and he would predict the year, month, week,[^7-8] and day
as though he were a god himself.

鄭人見之皆棄而走
When the people of Zheng saw him,
they dropped everything and ran out of his way.

列子見之而心醉
Liezi went to see him and was completely intoxicated.

歸以告壺子曰
始吾以夫子之道為至矣
Returning, he said to Huzi,[^7-9]
"I used to think, Master, that your Way was perfect.

則又有至焉者矣
But now I see there is something even higher!"

***

壺子曰
吾與汝既其文
未既其實
Huzi said,
"I have already showed you all the outward forms,
but I haven't yet showed you the substance---
而固得道與
and do you really think you have mastered this Way of mine?

眾雌
而無雄
而又奚卵焉
There may be a flock of hens,
but if there is no rooster,
how can they lay fertile eggs?

而以道與世亢必信
You take what you know of the Way
and wave it in the face of the world,
expecting to be believed!

夫故使人得而相女
This is the reason men can see right through you.

嘗試與來以予示之
Try bringing your shaman along next time
and letting him get a look at me."

***

明日列子與之見壺子
The next day Liezi brought the shaman to see Huzi.

出而謂列子曰
嘻
When they had left the room, the shaman said,
"I'm so sorry---
子之先生死矣
your master is dying!

弗活矣
There's no life left in him---
不以旬數矣
he won't last the week.

吾見怪焉
I saw something very strange---
見溼灰焉
something like wet ashes!"

***

列子入泣涕沾襟以告壺子
Liezi went back into the room,
weeping and drenching the collar of his robe with tears,
and reported this to Huzi.

***

壺子曰
鄉吾示之以地文
Huzi said,
"Just now I appeared to him with the Pattern of Earth---
萌乎不震不正
still and silent, nothing moving, nothing standing up.

是殆見吾杜德機也
He probably saw in me the Workings of Virtue Closed Off.[^7-10]

嘗又與來
Try bringing him around again."

***

明日又與之見壺子
出而謂列子曰
幸矣子之先生遇我也
The next day the two came to see Huzi again,
and when they had left the room, the shaman said to Liezi,
"It certainly was lucky that your master met me!

有瘳矣
He's going to get better---
全然有生矣
he has all the signs of life!

吾見其杜權矣
I could see the stirring of what had been closed off!"

***

列子入以告壺子
Liezi went in and reported this to Huzi.

***

壺子曰
鄉吾示之以天壤
Huzi said,
"Just now I appeared to him as Heaven and Earth---
名實不入而機發於踵
no name or substance to it,
but still the workings, coming up from the heels.

是殆見吾善者機也
He probably saw in me the Workings of the Good One.[^7-11]

嘗又與來
Try bringing him again."

***

明日又與之見壺子
出而謂列子曰
子之先生不齊
The next day the two came to see Huzi again,
and when they had left the room, the shaman said to Liezi,
"Your master is never the *same*!

吾無得而相焉
I have no way to physiognomize him!

試齊且復相之
If he will try to steady himself,
then I will come and examine him again."

***

列子入以告壺子
Liezi went in and reported this to Huzi.

***

壺子曰
吾鄉示之以太沖莫勝
Huzi said,
"Just now I appeared to him as
the Great Vastness Where Nothing Wins Out.

是殆見吾衡氣機也
He probably saw in me
the Workings of the Balanced Breaths.

鯢桓之審為淵
Where the swirling waves[^7-12] gather, there is an abyss;
止水之審為淵
where the still waters gather, there is an abyss;
流水之審為淵
where the running waters gather, there is an abyss.

淵有九名此處三焉
The abyss has nine names, and I have shown him three.[^7-13]

嘗又與來
Try bringing him again."

***

明日又與之見壺子
立未定
自失而走
The next day the two came to see Huzi again,
but before the shaman had even come to a halt before Huzi,
his wits left him and he fled.

***

壺子曰
追之列子追之不及
"Run after him!"
said Huzi,
but though Liezi ran after him, he could not catch up.

反以報壺子曰
已滅矣
Returning, he reported to Huzi,
"He's vanished!

已失矣
He's disappeared!

吾弗及也
I couldn't catch up with him."

***

壺子曰
鄉吾示之以未始出吾宗
Huzi said,
"Just now I appeared to him as Not Yet Emerged from My Source.

吾與之虛而委蛇
不知其誰何
因以為弟靡
因以為波流
I came at him empty, wriggling and turning,
not knowing anything about 'who' or 'what,'
now dipping and bending,
now flowing in waves---
故逃也
that's why he ran away."

***

然後列子自以為未始學
After this, Liezi concluded
that he had never really begun to learn anything.[^7-14]

而歸三年不出
He went home and, for three years, did not go out.

為其妻爨
食豕如食人
於事無與親
He replaced his wife at the stove,
fed the pigs as though he were feeding people,
and showed no preferences in the things he did.

彫琢復朴
塊然獨以其形立
He got rid of the carving and polishing and returned to plainness,
letting his body stand alone like a clod.

紛而封哉一以是終
In the midst of entanglement he remained sealed,
and in this oneness he ended his life.

---

無為名尸
Do not be an embodier for fame;
無為謀府
do not be a storehouse of schemes;
無為事任
do not be an undertaker of projects;
無為知主
do not be a proprietor of wisdom.

體盡無窮而遊無朕
Embody to the fullest what has no end
and wander where there is no trail.

盡其所受於天而無見得
Hold on to all that you have received from Heaven,
but do not think you have gotten anything.

亦虛而已
Be empty, that is all.

至人之用心若鏡
The Perfect Man uses his mind like a mirror---
不將不迎應而不藏
going after nothing, welcoming nothing, responding but not storing.

故能勝物而不傷
Therefore he can win out over things and not hurt himself.

南海之帝為儵
The emperor of the South Sea was called Shu [Brief];
北海之帝為忽
the emperor of the North Sea was called Hu [Sudden];
中央之帝為渾沌
and the emperor of the central region was called Hundun [Chaos].

儵與忽時相與遇於渾沌之地
渾沌待之甚善
From time to time, Shu and Hu
came together for a meeting in the territory of Hundun,
and Hundun treated them very generously.

儵與忽謀報渾沌之德
Shu and Hu discussed how they could repay his kindness.

曰人皆有七竅以視聽食息
"All men," they said,
"have seven openings so they can see, hear, eat, and breathe.

此獨無有
But Hundun alone doesn't have any.

嘗試鑿之
Let's trying boring him some!"

***

日鑿一竅七日而渾沌死
Every day they bored another hole,
and on the seventh day Hundun died.
