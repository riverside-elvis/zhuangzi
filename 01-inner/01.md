## 1 逍遙遊 Free and Easy Wandering

北冥有魚其名為鯤
In the northern darkness there is a fish and his name is Kun.[^1-1]

鯤之大不知其幾千里也
The Kun is so huge I don't know how many thousand *li* he measures.

化而為鳥其名為鵬
He changes and becomes a bird whose name is Peng.

鵬之背不知其幾千里也
怒而飛其翼若垂天之雲
The back of the Peng
measures I don't know how many thousand *li* across,
and when he rises up and flies off,
his wings are like clouds all over the sky.

是鳥也海運則將徙於南冥
南冥者天池也
When the sea begins to move,[^1-2]
this bird sets off for the southern darkness,
which is the Lake of Heaven.

***

齊諧者志怪者也諧之言曰
The _Universal Harmony_[^1-3] records various wonders, and it says:
鵬之徙於南冥也水擊三千里
"When the Peng journeys to the southern darkness,
the waters are roiled for three thousand *li*.

摶扶搖而上者九萬里
去以六月息者也
He beats the whirlwind and rises ninety thousand *li*,
setting off on the sixth-month gale."

野馬也
塵埃也
生物之以息相吹也
Wavering heat,
bits of dust,
living things blown about by the wind---
天之蒼蒼
the sky looks very blue.

其正色邪其遠而無所至極邪
Is that its real color,
or is it because it is so far away and has no end?
其視下也亦若是則已矣
When the bird looks down, all he sees is blue, too.

***

且夫水之積也不厚則負大舟也無力
If water is not piled up deep enough,
it won't have the strength to bear up a big boat.

覆杯水於坳堂之上則芥為之舟
Pour a cup of water into a hollow in the floor,
and bits of trash will sail on it like boats.

置杯焉則膠水淺而舟大也
But set the cup there, and it will stick fast,
for the water is too shallow and the boat too large.

風之積也不厚則其負大翼也無力
If wind is not piled up deep enough,
it won't have the strength to bear up great wings.

故九萬里則風斯在下矣
Therefore when the Peng rises ninety thousand *li*,
he must have the wind under him like that.

而後乃今培風背
負青天而莫之夭閼者
Only then can he mount on the back of the wind,
shoulder the blue sky, and nothing can hinder or block him.

而後乃今將圖南
Only then can he set his eyes to the south.

***

蜩與學鳩笑之曰
我決起而飛槍榆枋
時則不至而控於地而已矣
The cicada and the little dove laugh at this saying,
"When we make an effort and fly up,
we can get as far as the elm or the sapanwood tree,
but sometimes we don't make it and just fall down on the ground.

奚以之九萬里而南為
Now how is anyone going to go ninety thousand *li* to the south!"

***

適莽蒼者三湌而反腹猶果然
If you go off to the green woods nearby,
you can take along food for three meals
and come back with your stomach as full as ever.

適百里者宿舂糧
If you are going a hundred *li*,
you must grind your grain
the night before;
適千里者三月聚糧
and if you are going a thousand *li*,
you must start getting the provisions together
three months in advance.

之二蟲又何知
What do these two creatures understand?
小知不及大知
Little understanding
cannot come up to great understanding;
小年不及大年
the short-lived cannot come up to the long-lived.

***

奚以知其然也
How do I know this is so?
朝菌不知晦朔
The morning mushroom knows nothing of twilight and dawn;
蟪蛄不知春秋
the summer cicada knows nothing of spring and autumn.

此小年也
They are the short-lived.

楚之南有冥靈者
以五百歲為春
五百歲為秋
South of Chu there is a caterpillar
that counts five hundred years as one spring
and five hundred years as one autumn.

上古有大椿者
以八千歲為春
八千歲為秋
Long, long ago there was a great rose of Sharon
that counted eight thousand years as one spring
and eight thousand years as one autumn.

［此大年也］[^rse-01-1]
They are the long-lived.

而彭祖乃今以久特聞眾人匹之
Yet Pengzu[^1-4] alone is famous today for having lived a long time,
and everybody tries to ape him.

不亦悲乎
Isn't it pitiful!

***

湯之問棘也是已
Among the questions of Tang to Qi we find the same thing.[^1-5]

窮髮之北有冥海者天池也
In the bald and barren north,
there is a dark sea,
the Lake of Heaven.

有魚焉其廣數千里
未有知其脩者
In it is a fish that is several thousand *li* across,
and no one knows how long.

其名為鯤
His name is Kun.

有鳥焉其名為鵬
背若泰山
翼若垂天之雲
There is also a bird there, named Peng,
with a back like Mount Tai
and wings like clouds filling the sky.

摶扶搖羊角而上者九萬里
絕雲氣負青天
然後圖南且適南冥也
He beats the whirlwind, leaps into the air,
and rises up ninety thousand *li*,
cutting through the clouds and mist, shouldering the blue sky,
and then he turns his eyes south and prepares to journey
to the southern darkness.

***

斥鴳笑之曰
彼且奚適也
The little quail laughs at him, saying,
"Where does he think *he's* going?

我騰躍而上不過數仞
而下翱翔蓬蒿之間
I give a great leap and fly up,
but I never get more than ten or twelve yards
before I come down fluttering among the weeds and brambles.

此亦飛之至也
And that's the best kind of flying, anyway!

而彼且奚適也
Where does he think he's going?"

此小大之辯也
Such is the difference between big and little.

***

故夫知效一官
行比一鄉
德合一君
而徵一國者
其自視也亦若此矣
Therefore a man
who has wisdom enough to fill one office effectively,
good conduct enough to impress one community,
virtue enough to please one ruler,
or talent enough to be called into service in one state,
has the same kind of self-pride as these little creatures.

而宋榮子猶然笑之
Song Rongzi[^1-6] would certainly burst out laughing at such a man.

且舉世而譽之而不加勸
The whole world could praise Song Rongzi
and it wouldn't make him exert himself;
舉世而非之而不加沮
the whole world could condemn him
and it wouldn't make him mope.

定乎內外之分
辯乎榮辱之竟
He drew a clear line between the internal and the external
and recognized the boundaries of true glory and disgrace.

斯已矣
But that was all.

彼其於世未數數然也
As far as the world went, he didn't fret and worry,
雖然猶有未樹也
but there was still ground he left unturned.

***

夫列子御風而行泠然善也
旬有五日而後反
Liezi[^1-7] could ride the wind and go soaring around
with cool and breezy skill,
but after fifteen days he came back to earth.

彼於致福者未數數然也
As far as the search for good fortune went,
he didn't fret and worry.

此雖免乎行猶有所待者也
He escaped the trouble of walking,
but he still had to depend on something to get around.

若夫乘天地之正而御六氣之辯
以遊無窮者彼且惡乎待哉
If he had only mounted on the truth of Heaven and Earth,
ridden the changes of the six breaths,
and thus wandered through the boundless,
then what would he have had to depend on?

***

故曰
至人無己
Therefore I say,
the Perfect Man has no self;
神人無功
the Holy Man has no merit;
聖人無名
the Sage has no fame.[^1-8]

堯讓天下於許由
Yao wanted to cede the empire to Xu You.

曰日月出矣而爝火不息其於光也不亦難乎
"When the sun and moon have already come out," he said,
"it's a waste of light to go on burning the torches, isn't it?

時雨降矣而猶浸灌其於澤也不亦勞乎
When the seasonal rains are falling,
it's a waste of water to go on irrigating the fields.

夫子立而天下治
If you took the throne, the world would be well ordered.

而我猶尸之吾自視缺然
I go on occupying it, but all I can see are my failings.

請致天下
I beg to turn over the world to you."

***

許由曰
子治天下天下既已治也
Xu You said,
"You govern the world and the world is already well governed.

而我猶代子吾將為名乎
Now if I take your place,
will I be doing it for a name?

名者實之賓也
But name is only the guest of reality---
吾將為賓乎
will I be doing it so I can play the part of a guest?

鷦鷯巢於深林不過一枝
When the tailorbird builds her nest in the deep wood,
she uses no more than one branch.

偃鼠飲河不過滿腹
When the mole drinks at the river,
he takes no more than a bellyful.

歸休乎君
Go home and forget the matter, my lord.

予無所用天下為
I have no use for the rulership of the world!

庖人雖不治庖
尸祝不越樽俎而代之矣
Though the cook may not run his kitchen properly,
the priest and the impersonator of the dead at the sacrifice
do not leap over the wine casks and sacrificial stands
and go take his place." [^1-9]

肩吾問於連叔曰
吾聞言於接輿
Jian Wu said to Lian Shu,
"I was listening to Jie Yu's talk---
大而無當往而不反
big and nothing to back it up,
going on and on without turning around.

吾驚怖其言
I was completely dumbfounded at his words---
猶河漢而無極也大有逕
庭不近人情焉
no more end than the Milky Way, wild and wide of the mark,
never coming near human affairs!"

***

連叔曰
其言謂何哉
"What were his words like?" asked Lian Shu.

***

曰藐姑射之山有神人居焉
肌膚若冰雪
淖約若處子
"He said that there is a Holy Man
living on faraway Gushe Mountain,
with skin like ice or snow
and gentle and shy like a young girl.

不食五穀吸風飲露
乘雲氣御飛龍而遊乎四海之外
He doesn't eat the five grains but sucks the wind, drinks the dew,
climbs up on the clouds and mist, rides a flying dragon,
and wanders beyond the four seas.

其神凝使物不疵癘而年穀熟
By concentrating his spirit,
he can protect creatures from sickness and plague
and make the harvest plentiful.

吾以是狂而不信也
I thought this all was insane and refused to believe it."

***

連叔曰
然
"You would!"
said Lian Shu.

瞽者無以與乎文章之觀
聾者無以與乎鍾鼓之聲
"We can't expect a blind man to appreciate beautiful patterns
or a deaf man to listen to bells and drums.

豈唯形骸有聾盲哉
And blindness and deafness are not confined to the body alone---
夫知亦有之是其言也猶時女也
the understanding has them, too,
as your words just now have shown.

之人也之德也
將旁礡萬物以為一
This man, with this virtue of his,
is about to embrace the ten thousand things and roll them into one.

世蘄乎亂孰弊弊焉以天下為事
Though the age calls for reform,
why should he wear himself out over the affairs of the world?

之人也物莫之傷
There is nothing that can harm this man.

大浸稽天而不溺
Though floodwaters pile up to the sky, he will not drown.

大旱金石流土山焦而不熱
Though a great drought melts metal and stone
and scorches the earth and hills, he will not be burned.

是其塵垢粃糠將猶陶鑄堯舜者也
From his dust and leavings alone,
you could mold a Yao or a Shun!

孰肯以物為事
Why should he consent to bother about mere things?"

---

宋人資章甫而適諸越
越人斷髮文身無所用之
A man of Song who sold ceremonial hats made a trip to Yue,
but the Yue people cut their hair short and tattooed their bodies
and had no use for such things.

堯治天下之民
平海內之政
Yao brought order to the people of the world
and directed the government of all within the seas.

往見四子藐姑射之山
汾水之陽
窅然喪其天下焉
But he went to see the Four Masters
of the faraway Gushe Mountain,
[and when he got home] north of the Fen River,
he was dazed and had forgotten his kingdom there.

惠子謂莊子曰
魏王貽我大瓠之種
Huizi[^1-10] said to Zhuangzi,
"The king of Wei gave me some seeds of a huge gourd.

我樹之成而實五石
I planted them, and when they grew up,
the fruit was big enough to hold five piculs.

以盛水漿其堅不能自舉也
I tried using it for a water container,
but it was so heavy I couldn't lift it.

剖之以為瓢則瓠落無所容
I split it in half to make dippers,
but they were so large and unwieldy
that I couldn't dip them into anything.

非不呺然大也
It's not that the gourds weren't fantastically big---
吾為其無用而掊之
but I decided they were of no use,
and so I smashed them to pieces."

***

莊子曰
夫子固拙於用大矣
Zhuangzi said,
"You certainly are dense
when it comes to using big things!

宋人有善為不龜手之藥者
世世以洴澼絖為事
In Song there was a man who was skilled at
making a salve to prevent chapped hands,
and generation after generation his family
made a living by bleaching silk in water.

客聞之請買其方百金
A traveler heard about the salve
and offered to buy the prescription for a hundred measures of gold.

聚族而謀
The man called everyone to a family council.

曰我世世為洴澼絖不過數金
'For generations we've been bleaching silk,
and we've never made more than a few measures of gold,' he said.

今一朝而鬻技百金
'Now, if we sell our secret,
we can make a hundred measures in one morning.

請與之
Let's let him have it!'

客得之以說吳王越有難
The traveler got the salve and introduced it to the king of Wu,
who was having trouble with the state of Yue.

吳王使之將
冬與越人水戰大敗越人
The king put the man in charge of his troops,
and that winter they fought a naval battle
with the men of Yue and gave them a bad beating.[^1-11]

裂地而封之
A portion of the conquered territory
was awarded to the man as a fief.

能不龜手一也
The salve had the power to prevent chapped hands in either case;
或以封或不免於洴澼絖
but one man used it to get a fief,
while the other one never got beyond silk bleaching---
則所用之異也
because they used it in different ways.

今子有五石之瓠
Now you had a gourd big enough to hold five piculs.

何不慮以為大樽而浮乎江湖
而憂其瓠落無所容
Why didn't you think of making it into a great tub
so you could go floating around the rivers and lakes,
instead of worrying because
it was too big and unwieldy to dip into things!
則夫子猶有蓬之心也夫
Obviously you still have a lot of underbrush in your head!"

---

惠子謂莊子曰
吾有大樹人謂之樗
Huizi said to Zhuangzi,
"I have a big tree called a shu.

其大本擁腫而不中繩墨
其小枝卷曲而不中規矩
Its trunk is too gnarled and bumpy to apply a measuring line to,
its branches too bent and twisty to match up to a compass or square.

立之塗匠者不顧
You could stand it by the road,
and no carpenter would look at it twice.

今子之言大而無用眾所同去也
Your words, too, are big and useless,
and so everyone alike spurns them!"

***

莊子曰
子獨不見狸狌乎
Zhuangzi said,
"Maybe you've never seen a wildcat or a weasel.

卑身而伏以候敖者
It crouches down and hides,
watching for something to come along.

東西跳梁不避高下
It leaps and races east and west,
not hesitating to go high or low---
中於機辟
死於罔罟
until it falls into the trap and dies in the net.

今夫斄牛其大若垂天之雲
Then again there's the yak,
big as a cloud covering the sky.

此能為大矣而不能執鼠
It certainly knows how to be big,
though it doesn't know how to catch rats.

今子有大樹患其無用
Now you have this big tree,
and you're distressed because it's useless.

何不樹之於
無何有之鄉
廣莫之野
彷徨乎無為其側
逍遙乎寢臥其下
Why don't you plant it in Not-Even-Anything Village
or the field of Broad-and-Boundless,
relax and do nothing by its side,
or lie down for a free and easy sleep under it?

不夭斤斧物無害者
Axes will never shorten its life,
nothing can ever harm it.

無所可用安所困苦哉
If there's no use for it,
how can it come to grief or pain?"
