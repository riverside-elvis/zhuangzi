[^1-1]: *Kun* means ﬁsh roe.
So Zhuangzi begins with a paradox---the tiniest fish imaginable
is also the largest fish imaginable.

[^1-2]: Probably a reference to some seasonal shift
in the tides or currents.

[^1-3]: Identiﬁed variously as the name of a man or the name of a book.
Probably Zhuangzi intended it as the latter
and is poking fun at the philosophers of other schools
who cite ancient texts to prove their assertions.

[^1-4]: Said to have lived to an incredible old age. See p. 46, n. 12.

[^1-5]: The text may be faulty at this point.
The _Beishanlu_, a work written around 800 CE by the monk Shenqing,
contains the following passage,
said by a Tang commentator on the _Beishanlu_ to be found in the _Zhuangzi_:
"Tang asked Qi, 'Do up, down, and the four directions have a limit?'
Qi replied, 'Beyond their limitlessness there is still another limitlessness.'" 
But whether this passage was in the original _Zhuangzi_
or whether, if it was, it belongs at this point in the text,
are questions that cannot be answered.

[^1-6]: Referred to elsewhere in the literature of the period
as Song Jian or Song Keng.
According to the last section of the _Zhuangzi_,
he taught a doctrine of social harmony, frugality, pacifism,
and the rejection of conventional standards of honor and disgrace.

[^1-7]: Lie Yukou, a Daoist philosopher
frequently mentioned in the _Zhuangzi_.
The _Liezi_, a work attributed to him,
is of uncertain date and did not reach its present form
until the third or fourth centuries CE.

[^1-8]: Not three different categories but three names for the same thing.

[^1-9]: Or following another interpretation,
"the priest and the impersonator of the dead
do not snatch his wine casks and chopping board away from him
and take his place."

[^1-10]:The logician Huizi who, as Waley pointed out, in the _Zhuangzi_
"stands for intellectuality as opposed to imagination."

[^1-11]: Because the salve, by preventing the soldiers' hands from chapping,
made it easier for them to handle their weapons.

[^2-1]: The word "companion" is interpreted variously to mean
his associates, his wife, or his own body.

[^2-2]: Heaven is not something distinct from earth and man,
but a name applied to the natural and spontaneous functioning of the two.

[^2-3]: Reading *dan* instead of *yan*.

[^2-4]: According to the last section of the _Zhuangzi_,
this was one of the paradoxes of the logician Huizi.

[^2-5]: Following the interpretation of Zhang Binglin.
The older interpretation of yin here and in the following sentences is,
"What is the Way hidden by," etc.

[^2-6]: *Tian*, which for Zhuangzi means Nature or the Way.

[^2-7]: A reference to the statements of the logician Gongsun Long,
"A white horse is not a horse"
and "Attributes are not attributes in and of themselves."

[^2-8]: Zhao Wen was a famous lute (*qin*) player.
But the best music he could play (i.e., complete)
was only a pale and partial reflection of the ideal music,
which was thereby injured and impaired,
just as the unity of the Way was injured by the appearance of love---that is,
man's likes and dislikes.
Hence, when Mr. Zhao refrained from playing the lute,
there was neither completion nor injury.

[^2-9]: The logicians Huizi and Gongsun Long
spent much time discussing the relationship between attributes
such as "hard" and "white" and the thing to which they pertain.

[^2-10]: Following Yu-lan Fung and Fukunaga, I read *fu* instead of *wen*.

[^2-11]: He accepts things as they are,
though to the ordinary person attempting to establish values,
they appear chaotic and doubtful and in need of clarification.

[^2-12]: The strands of animal fur
were believed to grow particularly fine in autumn;
hence "the tip of an autumn hair" is a cliché for something extremely tiny.
Pengzu, the Chinese Methuselah, appeared on p. 2.

[^2-13]: Following the reading in the Cui text.

[^2-14]: Many commentators and translators
try to give the word *de* some special meaning
other than its ordinary one of "virtue" in this context.
But I believe Zhuangzi is deliberately parodying the ethical categories
of the Confucians and Mohists.

[^2-15]: Heaven, earth, and the four directions, that is, the universe.

[^2-16]: Perhaps a reference to the _Spring and Autumn Annals_,
a history of the state of Lu said to have been compiled by Confucius.
But it may be a generic term referring to the chronicles
of the various feudal states.

[^2-17]: Reading *zhou* instead of *cheng*.

[^2-18]: All are originally perfect but may become "squared," that is,
impaired, by the misuses mentioned.

[^2-19]: Or according to another interpretation, "the Precious Light."

[^2-20]: Here virtue is to be under stood in a good sense,
as the power of the Way.

[^2-21]: She was taken captive by Duke Xian of Jin in 671 BCE
and later became his consort.

[^2-22]: I follow the rearrangement of the text suggested by Lü Huiqing.
But the text of this whole paragraph leaves much to be desired,
and the translation is tentative.

[^2-23]: That is, to ordinary men the shadow
appears to depend on something else for its movement,
just as the snake depends on its scales (according to Chinese belief)
and the cicada on its wings.
But do such causal views of action really have any meaning?

[^3-1]: The chapter is very brief and would appear to be mutilated.

[^3-2]: Identified as King Hui of Wei, who appeared on p. 5.

[^3-3]: The Mulberry Grove is identified as a rain dance
from the time of King Tang of the Shang dynasty,
and the Jingshou music, as part of a longer composition from the time of Yao.

[^3-4]: Waley (_Three Ways of Thought in Ancient China_, p. 73)
takes this whole paragraph to refer to the working methods
of a mediocre carver and hence translates it very differently.
There is a great deal to be said for his interpretation,
but after much consideration I have decided to follow
the traditional interpretation because it seems to me
that the extreme care and caution that the cook uses
when he comes to a difficult place
is also a part of Zhuangzi's "secret of caring for life."

[^3-5]: Probably the ex–Commander of the Right,
as he has been punished by having one foot amputated,
a common penalty in ancient China.
It is mutilating punishments such as these
that Zhuangzi has in mind when he talks about the need to "stay in one piece."

[^3-6]: Laozi, the reputed author of the _Daodejing_.

[^3-7]: The first part of this last sentence is scarcely intelligible,
and there are numerous suggestions for how it should be interpreted or emended.
I follow Zhu Guiyao in reading "grease" instead of "finger."
For the sake of reference, I list some of the other possible interpretations
as I understand them:
"When the fingers complete the work of adding firewood,
the fire passes on" (Guo Xiang);
"Though the fingers are worn out gathering firewood,
the fire passes on" (Yu Yue);
"What we can point to are the fagots that have been consumed,
but the fire is transmitted elsewhere" (Legge, Fukunaga).

[^4-1]: Yan Hui was Confucius's favorite disciple.
Throughout this chapter Zhuangzi refers to a number of historical figures,
many of whom appear in the _Analects_, though the speeches and anecdotes
that he invents for them have nothing to do with history.

[^4-2]: Omitting the *guo*, following Xi Tong.
But there are many other interpretations of this peculiar sentence.

[^4-3]: I follow Ma Xulun in taking this sentence to refer to Yan Hui.
The older interpretation of Guo Xiang takes it to mean:
"He [the ruler of Wei] puts on a fine outward show and is very overbearing;
his expression is never fixed, and ordinary men do not try to oppose him."

[^4-4]: Not the natural or "given" mind
but the mind that makes artificial distinctions.

[^4-5]: Following Zhang Binglin, I read *dou* instead of *du*.

[^4-6]: The body sits, but the mind continues to race.

[^4-7]: Mythical sage rulers.

[^4-8]: A high minister of Chu and a relative of the king.

[^4-9]: The excitement and worry of success
will upset the balance of the yin and yang within the body
and bring about sickness.

[^4-10]: The latter part of the sentence is barely intelligible
and the translation tentative.
Legge's interpretation is ingenious though strained:
"In my diet I take what is coarse, and do not seek delicacies,---a
man whose cookery does not require him to be using cooling drinks."

[^4-11]: *Yi*,
elsewhere translated as "righteousness."

[^4-12]: The phrase *zhiming* can be interpreted as
either "following orders" or "obeying fate,"
and both meanings are almost certainly intended.
Since for Zhuangzi, obeying fate is an extremely easy thing to do,
the last part of the sentence is ironic.
Throughout this passage Confucius, while appearing to give advice
on how to carry out a diplomatic mission, is in fact enunciating
Zhuangzi's code for successful behavior in general.

[^4-13]: Yan He was a scholar of Lu, Ju Boyu a minister of Wei.
The crown prince is the notorious Kuaikui, who was forced to flee
from Wei because he plotted to kill his mother.
He reentered the state and seized the throne from his son in 481 BCE.

[^4-14]: Waley (_Three Ways of Thought in Ancient China_, p. 109) translates,
"And if you probe him, do so in a part where his skin is not sore,"
taking the verb *da*, which I have translated as
"understand thoroughly," to refer to acupuncture.

[^4-15]: The shrine, or altar of the soil,
was always situated in a grove of beautiful trees.
So the oak was serving a purpose by lending an air of sanctity to the spot.

[^4-16]: Following Ma Xulun, I read *mian* (roof) in place of *ming*.

[^4-17]: Probably a spring sacrifice for the "dispelling (*jie*) of sins,"
though there are other interpretations.
Sacrifices of animals, and sometimes human beings,
were made to the Lord of the River, the god of the Yellow River.

[^4-18]: Zhuangzi bases this passage on the somewhat similar anecdote
and song of the madman Jie Yu in _Analects_ XVIII, 5.

[^5-1]: As a penalty for some offense.

[^5-2]: The legs, arms, head, and trunk.

[^5-3]: Zichan (d. 522 BCE) was prime minister of the state of Zheng.

[^5-4]: Following Wang Maohong's suggestion,
I reverse the position of *nei* and *wai*.

[^5-5]: The meaning is doubtful.
I follow Guo Xiang in taking it to be a reference to the legend
that Confucius went to Laozi for instruction.

[^5-6]: The sentence is unclear.
Another interpretation would be:
"he is allowed to spend nights at home and is not required
to sleep in the officials' dormitory."

[^5-7]: A disciple of Confucius.

[^5-8]: Originally the text probably had some other phrase at this point
referring to the walk, back, or lips of normal men,
which dropped out and was replaced by the phrase
from the parallel sentence that follows.

[^5-9]: On "hard" and "white," see p. 12, n. 9.
Zhuangzi's description of Huizi is rhymed in the original.

[^6-1]: Another term for the Daoist sage,
synonymous with the Perfect Man or the Holy Man.

[^6-2]: Reading *wang* instead of *zhi*
in accordance with Wang Maohong's suggestion.

[^6-3]: According to legend,
these were men who either tried to reform the conduct of others
or made a show of guarding their own integrity.
All either were killed or committed suicide.

[^6-4]: Following the Cui text, which reads *guang*.

[^6-5]: There are many different interpretations of the words
used to describe the True Man in this paragraph.
I have followed those adopted by Fukunaga.

[^6-6]: As Fukunaga pointed out, this paragraph,
which describes the Daoist sage as a ruler who employs
penalties, rites, wisdom, and virtue,
seems out of keeping with Zhuangzi's philosophy as expressed elsewhere.
Fukunaga suggests that it is an addition
by a writer of the third or second centuries BCE
who was influenced by Legalist thought.

[^6-7]: Since Zhuangzi elsewhere uses *Tian* or Heaven
as a synonym of the Way, this passage has troubled commentators.
Some would emend the order of the words to read
"If a man is willing to regard his father as Heaven"
or would substitute *ren* for *Tian*, that is,
"If a man is willing to regard another man as his father."

[^6-8]: Or perhaps the meaning is "So if it makes my life good,
it must for the same reason make my death good."

[^6-9]: Following Yu Yue's interpretation.

[^6-10]: The figures in this paragraph all are deities or mythical beings,
but the myths to which Zhuangzi refers are in many cases unknown,
so that the translation is tentative in places.

[^6-11]: Kanpi is the god of the mythical Kunlun Mountains of the west;
Pingyi is the god of the Yellow River;
and Jian Wu is the god of Mount Tai.

[^6-12]: The Yellow Emperor and Zhuan Xu are legendary rulers.
The Queen Mother of the West is an immortal spirit
who lives in the far west. Yuqiang is a deity of the far north.
Pengzu's life span as given here extends, by traditional dating,
from the twenty-sixth to the seventh centuries BCE.

[^6-13]: Fu Yue is frequently mentioned as a minister
to the Shang ruler Wuding (traditional dates 1324–1266 BCE),
but little is known of the legend that he ascended to the sky
and became a star.

[^6-14]: Following Wen Yiduo's suggestion,
I reverse the position of *shou* and *gao*.

[^6-15]: That is, that which transcends the categories of life and death
can never be said to have lived or died;
only that which recognizes the existence of such categories
is subject to them.

[^6-16]: Reading *nishi* instead of *yishi* for the last name.
But these names are open to a variety of interpretations.
The whole list, of course, is a parody of the filiations
of the other schools of philosophy.

[^6-17]: A famous sword of King Helü (r. 514–496 BCE) of Wu.

[^6-18]: The word *fang*, which I have translated as "realm,"
may also mean "method" or "procedure,"
and Confucius's answer seems to stress this latter meaning.

[^6-19]: Following Xi Tong, I read *ze* instead of *shi*,
but the sentence is obscure and there are many interpretations.

[^6-20]: A recluse of the time of Emperor Yao. He appeared on p. 3.

[^6-21]: Tattooing and cutting off the nose were common punishments.

[^6-22]: Judging from the context, Wuzhuang and Juliang
must have been noted for their beauty and strength, respectively.
Perhaps the former is the same as the beautiful Maoqiang mentioned on p. 15.
All these persons forgot themselves in the Way
and were remolded by the Creator.

[^6-23]: Zhuangzi probably intends a humorous reference
to Confucius's words in _Analects_ VI, 9:
"The Master said, 'What a worthy man was Hui!'"

[^7-1]: On Nie Que and Wang Ni, see pp. 14-15.
Master Puyi is probably the same as Master Piyi,
who appears elsewhere in the _Zhuangzi_ as Wang Ni's teacher.
According to commentators, Nie Que's delight
came from the fact that he had finally realized
that there are no answers to questions.

[^7-2]: "The clansman Youyu" is the sage ruler Shun,
the ideal of the Confucian philosophers.
"The clansman Tai" is vaguely identified as a ruler of high antiquity.

[^7-3]: The existence of a category "not-man"
depends on the recognition of a category "man."
Shun could get no further than the category "man";
hence he never reached the realm of "not-man."
Tai, on the other hand, was able to transcend all such categories.

[^7-4]: Jian Wu and Jie Yu appeared on p. 4.
Nothing is known about Zhong Shi.
I follow Yu Yue in taking *ri* to mean "the other day."

[^7-5]: I follow the traditional interpretation,
though in fact no one has succeeded in determining the meaning
of this character for certain.
Other interpretations are
"How do you have the leisure to come," etc.,
or "What is this dream talk that you come with
about governing the world," etc.

[^7-6]: Perhaps meant to be identified
with the hedonist philosopher Yang Zhu.

[^7-7]: Reading *liu* in accordance with the parallel passage in sec. 12.

[^7-8]: The ancient ten-day week.

[^7-9]: The Daoist philosopher Liezi appeared on p. 3. Huzi is his teacher.

[^7-10]: Virtue here has the sense of vital force.
Compare _Book of Changes_, _Xici_ 2:
"The Great Virtue of Heaven and Earth is called life."

[^7-11]: The language of this whole passage is,
needless to say, deliberately mysterious.
The term "Good One" may have some relation
to the passage in the *Changes*, _Xici_ 1:
"The succession of the yin and yang is called the Way.
What carries it on is goodness."

[^7-12]: Following Ma Xulun's emendation and interpretation.

[^7-13]: According to commentators, the three forms of the abyss
in the order given here correspond to the third, first,
and second of Huzi's manifestations.

[^7-14]: That is, he had reached the highest stage of understanding.
