## 5 德充符 The sign of virtue complete

魯有兀者王駘
In Lu there was a man named Wang Tai
who had had his foot cut off.[^5-1]

從之遊者與仲尼相若
He had as many followers gathered around him as Confucius.

***

常季問於仲尼曰
王駘兀者也
Chang Ji asked Confucius,
"This Wang Tai who's lost a foot---
從之遊者與夫子中分魯
how does he get to divide up Lu with you,
Master, and make half of it his disciples?

立不教坐不議
虛而往實而歸
He doesn't stand up and teach,
he doesn't sit down and discuss,
yet they go to him empty
and come home full.

固有不言之教
無形而心成者邪
Does he really have some wordless teaching,
some formless way of bringing the mind to completion?

是何人也
What sort of man is he?"

***

仲尼曰
夫子聖人也
Confucius said,
"This gentleman is a sage.

丘也直後而未往耳
It's just that I've been tardy and haven't gone to see him yet.

丘將以為師而況不如丘者乎
But if I go to him as my teacher,
how much more should those who are not my equals!

奚假魯國
Why only the state of Lu?

丘將引天下而與從之
I'll bring the whole world along,
and we'll all become his followers!"

***

常季曰
彼兀者也而王先生其與庸亦遠矣
Chang Ji said,
"If he's lost a foot and is still superior to the Master,
then how far above the common run of men he must be!

若然者其用心也獨若之何
But if that's so,
then what unique way does he have of using his mind?"

***

仲尼曰
死生亦大矣而不得與之變
Confucius said,
"Life and death are great affairs,
and yet they are no change to him.

雖天地覆墜亦將不與之遺
Though heaven and earth flop over and fall down,
it is no loss to him.

審乎無假而不與物遷
He sees clearly into what has no falsehood
and does not shift with things.

命物之化而守其宗也
He takes it as fate that things should change,
and he holds fast to the source."

***

常季曰
何謂也
"What do you mean by that?"
asked Chang Ji.

***

仲尼曰
自其異者視之肝膽楚越也
Confucius said,
"If you look at them from the point of view of their differences,
then there is liver and gall, Chu and Yue.

自其同者視之萬物皆一也
But if you look at them
from the point of view of their sameness,
then the ten thousand things all are one.

夫若然者且不知耳目之所宜
A man like this doesn't know what his ears or eyes should approve---
而游心於德之和
he lets his mind play in the harmony of virtue.

物視其所一而不見其所喪
As for things, he sees them as one and does not see their loss.

視喪其足猶遺土也
He regards the loss of a foot as a lump of earth thrown away."

***

常季曰
彼為己
以其知得其心
以其心得其常心
Chang Ji said,
"In the way he goes about it,
he uses his knowledge to get at his mind
and uses his mind to get at the constant mind.

物何為最之哉
Why should things gather around *him*?"

***

仲尼曰
人莫鑑於流水
Confucius said,
"Men do not mirror themselves in running water---
而鑑於止水
they mirror themselves in still water.

唯止能止眾止
Only what is still can still the stillness of other things.

受命於地唯松柏獨也在
Of those that receive life from the earth,
the pine and cypress alone are best---
冬夏青青
they stay as green as ever in winter or summer.

受命於天唯［堯］[^rse-05-1]舜獨也正
Of those that receive life from Heaven,
Yao and Shun alone are best---
［在萬物之首］[^rse-05-2]
they stand at the head of the ten thousand things.

幸能正生以正眾生
Luckily they were able to order their lives
and thereby order the lives of other things.

夫保始之徵不懼之實
Proof that a man is holding fast to the beginning
lies in the fact of his fearlessness.

勇士一人雄入於九軍
A brave soldier will plunge alone
into the midst of nine armies.

將求名而能自要者
He seeks fame and can bring himself to this.

而猶若此
而況官天地府萬物
直寓六骸
象耳目
一知之所知
而心未嘗死者乎
How much more, then, is possible for a man
who governs Heaven and earth, stores up the ten thousand things,
lets the six parts of his body[^5-2] be only a dwelling,
makes ornaments of his ears and eyes,
unifies the knowledge of what he knows,
and in his mind never tastes death.

彼且擇日而登假
He will soon choose the day and ascend far off.

人則從是也
彼且何肯以物為事乎
Men may become his followers,
but how could he be willing to bother himself about things?"

申徒嘉兀者也
而與鄭子產同師於伯昏無人
Shentu Jia, who had lost a foot,
was studying under Bohun Wuren, along with Zichan of Zheng.[^5-3]

子產謂申徒嘉曰
我先出則子止
子先出則我止
Zichan said to Shentu Jia,
"If I go out first, you stay behind,
and if you go out first, I'll stay behind."

***

其明日又與合堂同席而坐
Next day the two of them were again sitting
on the same mat in the same hall.

子產謂申徒嘉曰
我先出則子止
子先出則我止
Zichan said to Shentu Jia,
"If I go out first, you stay behind,
and if you go out first, I'll stay behind!

今我將出
Now I will go out.

子可以止乎其未邪
Are you going to stay behind, or aren't you?

且子見執政而不違
When you see a prime minister, you don't even get out of the way---
子齊執政乎
do you think you're the equal of a prime minister?"


***

申徒嘉曰
先生之門固有執政焉如此哉
Shentu Jia said,
"Within the gates of the Master,
is there any such thing as a prime minister?

子而說子之執政而後人者也
You take delight in being a prime minister
and pushing people behind you.

聞之曰
鑑明則塵垢不止
But I've heard that
if the mirror is bright, no dust will settle on it;
止則不明也
if dust settles, it isn't really bright.

久與賢人處則無過
When you live around worthy men a long time,
you'll be free of faults.

今子之所取大者先生也而猶出言若是
You regard the Master as a great man,
and yet you talk like this---
不亦過乎
it's not right, is it?"

***

子產曰
子既若是矣
Zichan said,
"You, a man like this---
猶與堯爭善
and still you claim to be better than a Yao!

計子之德不足以自反邪
Take a look at your virtue
and see if it's not enough to give you cause to reflect!"

***

申徒嘉曰
自狀其過以不當亡者
Shentu Jia said,
"People who excuse their faults
and claim they didn't deserve to be punished---
眾
there are lots of them.

不狀其過以不當存者
But those who don't excuse their faults
and who admit they didn't deserve to be spared---
寡
they are few.

知不可奈何而安之若命
To know what you can't do anything about
and to be content with it as you would with fate---
惟有德者能之
only a man of virtue can do that.

遊於羿之彀中
中央者中地也
然而不中者命也
If you play around in front of Archer Yi's target,
you're right in the way of the arrows,
and if you don't get hit, it's a matter of fate.

人以其全足笑吾不全足者多矣
There are lots of men with two feet
who laugh at me for having only one.

我怫然而怒
而適先生之所則廢然而反
It makes me boil with rage,
but I come here to the Master's place,
and I feel calmed down again and go home.

不知先生之我以善邪
I don't know whether he washes me clean with goodness
or whether I come to understand things by myself.

吾與夫子遊十九年矣
而未嘗知吾兀者也
The Master and I have been friends for nineteen years,
and he's never once let on that he's aware I'm missing a foot.

今子與我遊於形骸之內
而子索我於形骸之外
Now you and I are supposed to be wandering
outside the realm of forms and bodies,
and you come looking for me inside it[^5-4]---
不亦過乎
you're at fault, aren't you?"

***

子產蹴然改容更貌
Zichan squirmed, changed his expression,
and put a different look on his face.

曰子無乃稱
"Say no more about it," he said.

---

魯有兀者叔山無趾
In Lu there was a man named Shushan No-Toes
who had had his foot cut off.

踵見仲尼
Stumping along, he went to see Confucius.

***

仲尼曰
子不謹
"You weren't careful enough!"
said Confucius.

前既犯患若是矣
雖今來何及矣
"Since you've already broken the law
and gotten yourself into trouble like this,
what do you expect to gain by coming to me now?"

***

無趾曰
吾唯不知務而輕用吾身
吾是以亡足
No-Toes said,
"I just didn't understand my duty
and was too careless of my body,
and so I lost a foot.

今吾來也猶有尊足者存
吾是以務全之也
But I've come now because I still have something
that is worth more than a foot
and I want to try to hold on to it.

夫天無不覆
地無不載
There is nothing that heaven doesn't cover,
nothing that earth doesn't bear up.

吾以夫子為天地
I supposed, Master, that you would be like heaven and earth.

安知夫子之猶若是也
How did I know you would act like this?"

***

孔子曰
丘則陋矣
"It was stupid of me,"
said Confucius.

夫子胡不入乎
"Please, sir, won't you come in?

請講以所聞
I'd like to describe to you what I have learned."

***

無趾出
But No-Toes went out.

***

孔子曰
弟子勉之
Confucius said,
"Be diligent, my disciples!

夫無趾兀者也
猶務學以復補前行之惡
Here is No-Toes, a man who has had his foot cut off,
and still he's striving to learn
so he can make up for the evil of his former conduct.

而況全德之人乎
How much more, then,
should men whose virtue is still unimpaired!"

***

無趾語老聃
No-Toes told the story to Lao Dan.

***

曰孔丘之於至人其未邪
"Confucius certainly hasn't reached
the stage of a Perfect Man, has he?

彼何賓賓以學子為
What does he mean coming around so obsequiously
to study with you?[^5-5]

彼且蘄以諔詭幻怪之名聞
不知至人之以是為己桎梏邪
He is after the sham illusion of fame and reputation
and doesn't know that the Perfect Man
looks on these as so many handcuffs and fetters!"

***

老聃曰
胡不直使彼
以死生為一條
以可不可為一貫者
Lao Dan said,
"Why don't you just make him see
that life and death are the same story,
that acceptable and unacceptable are on a single string?

解其桎梏其可乎
Wouldn't it be good to free him from his handcuffs and fetters?"

***

無趾曰
天刑之安可解
No-Toes said,
"When Heaven has punished him,
how can you set him free?"

---

魯哀公問於仲尼曰
衛有惡人焉曰哀駘它
Duke Ai of Lu said to Confucius,
"In Wei there was an ugly man named Ai Taituo.

丈夫與之處者思而不能去也
婦人見之請於父母曰
與為人妻寧
為夫子妾者
But when men were around him,
they thought only of him and couldn't break away,
and when women saw him,
they ran begging to their fathers and mothers, saying,
'I'd rather be this gentleman's concubine
than another man's wife!'---
十數而未止也
there were more than ten such cases,
and it hasn't stopped yet.

未嘗有聞其唱者也
No one ever heard him take the lead---
常和而已矣
he always just chimed in with other people.

無君人之位以濟乎人之死
無聚祿以望人之腹
He wasn't in the position of a ruler
in which he could save men's lives,
and he had no store of provisions
to fill men's bellies.

又以惡駭天下
和而不唱
知不出乎四域
On top of that, he was ugly enough to astound the whole world,
chimed in but never led,
and knew no more than what went on right around him.

且而雌雄合乎前
And yet men and women flocked to him.

是必有異乎人者也
寡人召而觀之
He certainly must be different from other men, I thought,
and I summoned him so I could have a look.

果
Just as they said---
以惡駭天下
he was ugly enough to astound the world.

與寡人處不至以月數
而寡人有意乎其為人也
不至乎期年而寡人信之
But he hadn't been with me more than a month or so
when I began to realize what kind of man he was,
and before the year was out, I really trusted him.

國無宰寡人傳國焉
There was no one in the state to act as chief minister,
and I wanted to hand over the government to him.

悶然而後應
氾而若辭
寡人醜乎卒授之國
He was vague about giving an answer,
evasive, as though he hoped to be let off,
and I was embarrassed, but in the end
I turned the state over to him.

無幾何也去寡人而行
Then, before I knew it, he left me and went away.

寡人卹焉
若有亡也
若無與樂是國也
I felt completely crushed,
as though I'd suffered a loss
and didn't have anyone left to enjoy my state with.

是何人者也
What kind of man is he, anyway?"

***

仲尼曰
丘也嘗使於楚矣
適見㹠子食於其死母者
Confucius said,
"I once went on a mission to Chu,
and as I was going along, I saw some little pigs
nursing at the body of their dead mother.

少焉眴若皆棄之而走
不見己焉爾
After a while, they gave a start,
and all ran away and left her because
they could no longer see their likeness in her;
不得類焉爾
she was not the same.

所愛其母者
非愛其形也
愛使其形者也
In loving their mother,
they loved not her body
but the thing that moved her body.

戰而死者
其人之葬也
不以翣資
When a man has been killed in battle
and people come to bury him,
he has no use for his medals.

刖者之屨
無為愛之
When a man has had his feet amputated,
he doesn't care much about shoes.

皆無其本矣
For both, the thing that is basic no longer exists.

為天子之諸御
不爪翦
不穿耳
When women are selected to be consorts of the Son of Heaven,
their nails are not pared
and their ears are not pierced.

娶妻者止於外
不得復使
When a man has just taken a wife,
he is kept in posts outside [the palace]
and is no longer sent on [dangerous] missions.[^5-6]

形全猶足以為爾而況全德之人乎
If so much care is taken to keep the body whole,
how much more in the case of a man whose virtue is whole?

今哀駘它
未言而信
無功而親
使人授己國唯恐其不受也
Now Ai Taituo
says nothing and is trusted,
accomplishes nothing and is loved,
so that people want to turn over their states to him
and are afraid only that he won't accept.

是必才全而德不形者也
It must be that his powers are whole,
though his virtue takes no form."

***

哀公曰
何謂才全
"What do you mean when you say his powers are whole?"
asked Duke Ai.

***

仲尼曰
死生存亡
窮達貧富
賢與不肖
毀譽饑渴寒暑
Confucius said,
"Life, death, preservation, loss,
failure, success, poverty, riches,
worthiness, unworthiness,
slander, fame, hunger, thirst, cold, heat---
是事之變
命之行也
these are the alternations of the world,
the workings of fate.

日夜相代乎前而知不能規乎其始者也
Day and night they change place before us,
and wisdom cannot spy out their source.

故不足以滑和
Therefore, they should not be enough to destroy your harmony;
不可入於靈府
they should not be allowed to enter the storehouse of spirit.

使之和豫通而不失於兌
If you can harmonize and delight in them, master them
and never be at a loss for joy;

使日夜無郤而與物為春
是接而生時於心者也
if you can do this day and night without break
and make it be spring with everything,
mingling with all
and creating the moment within your own mind---
是之謂才全
this is what I call being whole in power."

***

曰平者
"What do you mean when you say his virtue takes no form?"

***

水停之盛也其可以為法也
"Among level things, water at rest is the most perfect,
and therefore it can serve as a standard.

內保之而外不蕩也
It guards what is insidea and shows no movement outside.

德者成和之修也
Virtue is the establishment of perfect harmony.

德不形者物不能離也
Though virtue takes no form, things cannot break away from it."

***

哀公異日以告閔子
Some days later, Duke Ai reported his conversation to Min Zi.[^5-7]

曰始也吾以南面而君天下
執民之紀而憂其死
"At first, when I faced south and became ruler of the realm,
I tried to look after the regulation of the people
and worried that they might die.

吾自以為至通矣
I really thought I understood things perfectly.

今吾聞至人之言
恐吾無其實
But now that I've heard the words of a Perfect Man,
I'm afraid there was nothing to my understanding---
輕用吾身而亡其國
I was thinking too little of my own welfare and ruining the state.

吾與孔丘非君臣也
Confucius and I are not subject and ruler---
德友而已矣
we are friends in virtue, that's all."

---

闉跂支離無脤說衛靈公
靈公說之而視全人
其脰肩肩
Mr. Lame-Hunchback-No-Lips talked to Duke Ling of Wei,
and Duke Ling was so pleased with him
that when he looked at normal men,
he thought their necks looked too lean and skinny.[^5-8]

甕盎大癭說齊桓公
桓公說之而視全人
其脰肩肩
Mr. Pitcher-Sized-Wen talked to Duke Huan of Qi,
and Duke Huan was so pleased with him
that when he looked at normal men,
he thought their necks looked too lean and skinny.

故德有所長而形有所忘
Therefore, if virtue is preeminent,
the body will be forgotten.

人不忘其所忘
而忘其所不忘
But when men do not forget what can be forgotten
but forget what cannot be forgotten---
此謂誠忘
that may be called true forgetting.

***

故聖人有所遊
So the sage has his wanderings.

而知為孽
約為膠
德為接
工為商
For him, knowledge is an offshoot,
promises are glue,
favors are a patching up,
and skill is a peddler.

聖人不謀惡用知
The sage hatches no schemes, so what use has he for knowledge?

不斲惡用膠
He does no carving, so what use has he for glue?

無喪惡用德
He suffers no loss, so what use has he for favors?

不貨惡用商
He hawks no goods, so what use has he for peddling?

四者天鬻也
These four are called Heavenly Gruel.

天鬻者天食也
既受食於天又惡用人
Heavenly Gruel is the food of Heaven,
and if he's already gotten food from Heaven,
what use does he have for men?

有人之形
無人之情
He has the form of a man
but not the feelings of a man.

有人之形
故群於人
Since he has the form of a man,
he bands together with other men.

無人之情
故是非不得於身
Since he doesn't have the feelings of a man,
right and wrong cannot get at him.

眇乎小哉所以屬於人也
Puny and small, he sticks with the rest of men.

謷乎大哉獨成其天
Massive and great, he perfects his Heaven alone.

---

惠子謂莊子曰
人故無情乎
Huizi said to Zhuangzi,
"Can a man really be without feelings?"

莊子曰
然
Zhuangzi:
"Yes."

人而無情
Huizi:

how can you call him a man?"

***

莊子曰
道與之貌
Zhuangzi:
"The Way gave him a face;

Heaven gave him a form---
惡得不謂之人
why can't you call him a man?"

惠子曰
既謂之人惡得無情
Huizi:
"But if you've already called him a man,
how can he be without feelings?"

***

莊子曰
是非吾所謂情也
Zhuangzi:
"That's not what I mean by feelings.

吾所謂無情者
言人之不以好惡內傷其身
When I talk about having no feelings,
I mean that a man doesn't allow likes or dislikes
to get in and do him harm.

常因自然而不益生也
He just lets things be the way they are
and doesn't try to help life along."

***

惠子曰
不益生何以有其身
Huizi:
"If he doesn't try to help life along,
then how can he keep himself alive?"

***

莊子曰
道與之貌
Zhuangzi:
"The Way gave him a face;
天與之形
Heaven gave him a form.

無以好惡內傷其身
He doesn't let likes or dislikes get in and do him harm.

今子
You, now---
外乎子之神
you treat your spirit like an outsider.

勞乎子之精
倚樹而吟
據槁梧而瞑
You wear out your energy,
leaning on a tree and moaning,
slumping at your desk and dozing---
天選子之形子以堅白鳴
Heaven picked out a body for you
and you use it to gibber about 'hard' and 'white'!" [^5-9]
