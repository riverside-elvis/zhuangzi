## 3 養生主 The secret of caring for life

吾生也有涯而知也无涯
Your life has a limit, but knowledge has none.[^3-1]

以有涯隨无涯殆已
If you use what is limited to pursue what has no limit,
you will be in danger.

已而為知者殆而已矣
If you understand this and still strive for knowledge,
you will be in danger for certain!

為善无近名
If you do good, stay away from fame.

為惡无近刑
If you do evil, stay away from punishments.

緣督
Follow the middle;
以為經可以保身
可以全生
可以養親
可以盡年
go by what is constantand you can stay in one piece,
keep yourself alive,
look after your parents,
and live out your years.

庖丁為文惠君解牛
Cook Ding was cutting up an ox for Lord Wenhui.[^3-2]

手之所觸肩之所倚
足之所履膝之所踦
At every touch of his hand, every heave of his shoulder,
every move of his feet, every thrust of his knee---
砉然嚮然
zip! zoop!

奏刀騞然莫不中音
合於桑林之舞
乃中經首之會
He slithered the knife along with a zing,
and all was in perfect rhythm,
as though he were performing the dance of the Mulberry Grove
or keeping time to the Jingshou music.[^3-3]

***

文惠君曰
譆善哉
"Ah, this is marvelous!"
said Lord Wenhui.

技蓋至此乎
"Imagine skill reaching such heights!"

***

庖丁釋刀對曰
臣之所好者道也進乎技矣
Cook Ding laid down his knife and replied,
"What I care about is the Way, which goes beyond skill.

始臣之解牛之時所見无非牛者
When I first began cutting up oxen,
all I could see was the ox itself.

三年之後未嘗見全牛也
After three years I no longer saw the whole ox.

方今之時
And now---
臣以神遇而不以目視
now I go at it by spirit and don't look with my eyes.

官知止而神欲行
Perception and understanding have come to a stop,
and spirit moves where it wants.

依乎天理
批大郤
導大窾
因其固然
I go along with the natural makeup,
strike in the big hollows,
guide the knife through the big openings,
and follow things as they are.

技經肯綮之未嘗而況大軱乎
So I never touch the smallest ligament or tendon,
much less a main joint.

***

良庖歲更刀
"A good cook changes his knife once a year---
割也
because he cuts.

族庖月更刀
A mediocre cook changes his knife once a month---
折也
because he hacks.

今臣之刀十九年矣
所解數千牛矣
而刀刃若新發於硎
I've had this knife of mine for nineteen years
and I've cut up thousands of oxen with it,
and yet the blade is as good
as though it had just come from the grindstone.

彼節者有間而刀刃者无厚
There are spaces between the joints,
and the blade of the knife has really no thickness.

以无厚入有間恢恢乎其於遊
If you insert what has no thickness into such spaces,
then there's plenty of room---
刃必有餘地矣
more than enough for the blade to play about in.

是以十九年而刀刃若新發於硎
That's why after nineteen years,
the blade of my knife is still as good as
when it first came from the grindstone.

***

雖然每至於族
吾見其難為
怵然為戒
視為止
行為遲
動刀甚微
"However, whenever I come to a complicated place,
I size up the difficulties,
tell myself to watch out and be careful,
keep my eyes on what I'm doing,
work very slowly,
and move the knife with the greatest subtlety, until---
謋然已解如土委地
flop! the whole thing comes apart
like a clod of earth crumbling to the ground.

提刀而立為之四顧
為之躊躇滿志
善刀而藏之
I stand there holding the knife and look all around me,
completely satisfied and reluctant to move on,
and then I wipe off the knife and put it away." [^3-4]

***

文惠君曰
善哉
"Excellent!"
said Lord Wenhui.

吾聞庖丁之言得養生焉
"I have heard the words of Cook Ding
and learned how to care for life!"

***

公文軒見右師而驚曰
是何人也
When Gongwen Xuan saw the Commander of the Right,[^3-5]
he was startled and said,
"What kind of man is this?

惡乎介也
How did he come to lose his foot?

天與
Was it Heaven?

其人與
Or was it man?"

***

曰天也非人也
"It was Heaven, not man," said the commander.

天之生是使獨也
"When Heaven gave me life, it saw to it that I would be one-footed.

人之貌有與也
Men's looks are given to them.

以是知其天也非人也
So I know this was the work of Heaven and not of man.

澤雉十步一啄百步一飲
不蘄畜乎樊中
The swamp pheasant has to walk ten paces for one peck
and a hundred paces for one drink,
but it doesn't want to be kept in a cage.

神雖王不善也
Though you treat it like a king,
its spirit won't be content."

老聃死秦失弔之
三號而出
When Lao Dan[^3-6] died, Qin Shi went to mourn for him,
but after giving three cries, he left the room.

***

弟子曰
非夫子之友邪
"Weren't you a friend of the Master?"
asked Laozi's disciples.

***

曰然
"Yes."

***

然則弔焉若此可乎
"And you think it's all right to mourn him this way?"

***

曰然
"Yes," said Qin Shi.

始也吾以為其人也而今非也
"At first I took him for a real man,
but now I know he wasn't.

向吾入而弔焉
有老者哭之如哭其子
少者哭之如哭其母
A little while ago, when I went in to mourn,
I found old men weeping for him
as though they were weeping for a son,
and young men weeping for him
as though they were weeping for a mother.

彼其所以會之必有
不蘄言而言
不蘄哭而哭者
To have gathered a group like *that*, he must have done something
to make them talk about him, though he didn't ask them to talk
or make them weep for him, though he didn't ask them to weep.

是遁天倍情忘其所受
This is to hide from Heaven,
turn your back on the true state of affairs,
and forget what you were born with.

古者謂之
遁天之刑
In the old days, this was called
the crime of hiding from Heaven.

適來夫子時也
適去夫子順也
Your master happened to come because it was his time,
and he happened to leave because things follow along.

安時而處順哀樂不能入也
If you are content with the time and willing to follow along,
then grief and joy have no way to enter.

古者謂是
帝之縣解
In the old days, this was called
being freed from the bonds of God.

指窮於為薪火傳也
不知其盡也
"Though the grease burns out of the torch, the fire passes on,
and no one knows where it ends." [^3-7]
