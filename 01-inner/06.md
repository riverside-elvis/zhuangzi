## 6 大宗師 The great and venerable teacher

知天之所為
知人之所為者至矣
He who knows what it is that Heaven does,
and knows what it is that man does,
has reached the peak.

知天之所為者
天而生也
Knowing what it is that Heaven does,
he lives with Heaven.

知人之所為者
以其知之所知
以養其知之所不知
終其天年而不中道夭者
Knowing what it is that man does,
he uses the knowledge of what he knows
to help out the knowledge of what he doesn't know
and lives out the years that Heaven gave him
without being cut off midway---
是知之盛也
this is the perfection of knowledge.

***

雖然有患
However, there is a difficulty.

夫知有所待而後當
其所待者特未定也
Knowledge must wait for something before it can be applicable,
and that which it waits for is never certain.

庸詎知吾
所謂天之非人乎
所謂人之非天乎
How, then, can I know
that what I call Heaven is not really man
and what I call man is not really Heaven?

且有真人而後有真知
There must first be a True Man[^6-1]
before there can be true knowledge.

***

何謂真人
What do I mean by a True Man?

古之真人
不逆寡
不雄成
不謨士
The True Man of ancient times
did not rebel against want,
did not grow proud in plenty,
and did not plan his affairs.

若然者
過而弗悔
當而不自得也
A man like this
could commit an error and not regret it,
could meet with success and not make a show.

若然者
登高不慄
入水不濡
入火不熱
A man like this
could climb the high places and not be frightened,
could enter the water and not get wet,
could enter the fire and not get burned.

是知之能登假於道也若此
His knowledge was able to climb all the way up to the Way like this.

***

古之真人
其寢不夢
其覺無憂
The True Man of ancient times
slept without dreaming
and woke without care;
其食不甘
he ate without savoring;
其息深深
and his breath came from deep inside.

真人之息以踵
The True Man breathes with his heels;
眾人之息以喉
the mass of men breathe with their throats.

屈服者
其嗌言若哇
Crushed and bound down,
they gasp out their words as though they were retching.

其耆欲深者
其天機淺
Deep in their passions and desires,
they are shallow in the workings of Heaven.

***

古之真人
不知說生
不知惡死
The True Man of ancient times
knew nothing of loving life,
knew nothing of hating death.

其出不訢
He emerged without delight;
其入不距
he went back in without a fuss.

翛然而往
翛然而來而已矣
He came briskly,
he went briskly, and that was all.

不忘其所始
He didn't forget where he began;
不求其所終
he didn't try to find out where he would end.

受而喜之
He received something and took pleasure in it;
忘而復之
he forgot about it and handed it back again.

是之謂
不以心捐道
不以人助天
This is what I call
not using the mind to repel the Way,
not using man to help out Heaven.

是之謂真人
This is what I call the True Man.

***

若然者
其心志
Since he is like this,
his mind forgets;[^6-2]
其容寂
his face is calm;
其顙頯
his forehead is broad.

淒然似秋
煖然似春
喜怒通四時
He is chilly like autumn,
balmy like spring,
and his joy and anger prevail through the four seasons.

與物有宜而莫知其極
He goes along with what is right for things,
and no one knows his limit.

故聖人之用兵也亡國而不失人心
Therefore, when the sage calls out the troops,
he may overthrow nations,
but he will not lose the hearts of the people.

利澤施於萬物不為愛人
His bounty enriches ten thousand ages,
but he has no love for men.

故樂通物非聖人也
Therefore he who delights in bringing success to things
is not a sage;
有親非仁也
he who has affections
is not benevolent;
天時非賢也
he who looks for the right time
is not a worthy man;
利害不通非君子也
he who cannot encompass both profit and loss
is not a gentleman;
行名失己非士也
he who thinks of conduct and fame and misleads himself
is not a man of breeding;
亡身不真非役人也
and he who destroys himself and is without truth
is not a user of men.

若狐不偕
務光伯夷
叔齊箕子
胥餘紀他
申徒狄
Those like Hu Buxie,
Wu Guang, Bo Yi,
Shu Qi, Ji Zi,
Xu Yu, Ji Tuo,
and Shentu Di---
是役人之役
適人之適而不自適其適者也
all of them slaved in the service of other men,
took joy in bringing other men joy,
but could not find joy in any joy of their own.[^6-3]

***

古之真人
This was the True Man of old:
其狀義而不朋
his bearing was lofty and did not crumble;
若不足而不承
he appeared to lack but accepted nothing;
與乎其觚而不堅也
he was dignified in his correctness but not insistent;
張乎其虛而不華也
he was vast in his emptiness but not ostentatious.

邴邴乎其似喜乎
Mild and cheerful, he seemed to be happy;
崔乎其不得已乎
reluctant, he could not help doing certain things;
滀乎進我色也
annoyed, he let it show in his face;
與乎止我德也
relaxed, he rested in his virtue.

厲乎其似世乎
Tolerant,[^6-4] he seemed to be part of the world;
謷乎其未可制也
towering alone, he could be checked by nothing;
連乎其似好閉也
withdrawn, he seemed to prefer to cut himself off;
悗乎忘其言也
bemused, he forgot what he was going to say.[^6-5]

***

以刑為體
以禮為翼
以知為時
以德為循
He regarded penalties as the body,
rites as the wings,
wisdom as what is timely,
virtue as what is reasonable.

以刑為體者綽乎其殺也
Because he regarded penalties as the body,
he was benign in his killing.

以禮為翼者所以行於世也
Because he regarded rites as the wings,
he got along in the world.

以知為時者不得已於事也
Because he regarded wisdom as what is timely,
there were things that he could not keep from doing.

以德為循者
言其與有足者
至於丘也
Because he regarded virtue as what is reasonable,
he was like a man with two feet
who gets to the top of the hill.

而人真以為勤行者也
And yet people really believed that he worked hard to get there.[^6-6]

***

故其好之也一
其弗好之也一
Therefore his liking was one,
and his not liking was one.

其一也一
其不一也一
His being one was one,
and his not being one was one.

其一與天為徒
In being one, he was acting as a companion of Heaven.

其不一與人為徒
In not being one, he was acting as a companion of man.

天與人不相勝也是之謂真人
When man and Heaven do not defeat each other,
then we may be said to have the True Man.

***

死生命也
Life and death are fated---
其有夜旦之常天也
constant as the succession of dark and dawn,
a matter of Heaven.

人之有所不得與
There are some things that man can do nothing about---
皆物之情也
all are a matter of the nature of creatures.

彼特以天為父
而身猶愛之
而況其卓乎
If a man is willing to regard Heaven as a father
and to love it,
then how much more should he be willing to do
for that which is even greater![^6-7]

人特以有君為愈乎己
而身猶死之
而況其真乎
If he is willing to regard the ruler as superior to himself
and to die for him,
then how much more should he be willing to do
for the Truth!

***

泉涸魚
相與處於陸
相呴以溼
相濡以沫
When the springs dry up and the fish
are left stranded on the ground,
they spew one another with moisture
and wet one another down with spit---
不如
相忘於江湖
but it would be much better if they could
forget one another in the rivers and lakes.

與其譽堯而非桀
不如兩忘而化其道
Instead of praising Yao and condemning Jie,
it would be better to forget both of them
and transform yourself with the Way.

***

夫大塊
載我以形
勞我以生
佚我以老
息我以死
The Great Clod
burdens me with form,
labors me with life,
eases me in old age,
and rests me in death.

故善吾生者乃所以善吾死也
So if I think well of my life,
for the same reason I must think well of my death.[^6-8]

***

夫藏舟於壑
藏山於澤
謂之固矣
You hide your boat in the ravine
and your fish net[^6-9] in the swamp
and tell yourself that they will be safe.

然而夜半
有力者負之而走
昧者不知也
But in the middle of the night,
a strong man shoulders them and carries them off,
and in your stupidity, you don't know why it happened.

藏大小有宜
猶有所遯
You think you do right to hide little things in big ones,
and yet they get away from you.

若夫藏天下於天下而不得所遯
是恆物之大情也
But if you were to hide the world in the world,
so that nothing could get away,
this would be the final reality of the constancy of things.

***

特犯人之形而猶喜之
You have had the audacity to take on human form,
and you are delighted.

若人之形者萬化而未始有極也
But the human form has ten thousand changes
that never come to an end.

其為樂可勝計邪
Your joys, then, must be uncountable.

故聖人將遊於物之所不得遯而皆存
Therefore, the sage wanders in the realm
where things cannot get away from him,
and all are preserved.

善妖
He delights in early death;
善老
he delights in old age;
善始
he delights in the beginning;
善終
he delights in the end.

人猶效之
又況萬物之所係而一化之所待乎
If he can serve as a model for men,
how much more so that which the ten thousand things are tied to
and all changes alike wait for!

***

夫道
有情有信
無為無形
The Way
has its reality and its signs
but is without action or form.

可傳而不可受
You can hand it down, but you cannot receive it;
可得而不可見
you can get it, but you cannot see it.

自本自根
It is its own source, its own root.

未有天地自古以固存
Before Heaven and earth existed,
it was there, firm from ancient times.

神鬼神帝
It gave spirituality to the spirits and to God;
生天生地
it gave birth to Heaven and to earth.

在太極之先而不為高
It exists beyond the highest point,
and yet you cannot call it lofty;
在六極之下而不為深
it exists beneath the limit of the six directions,
and yet you cannot call it deep.

先天地生而不為久
It was born before Heaven and earth,
and yet you cannot say it has been there for long;
長於上古而不為老
it is earlier than the earliest time,
and yet you cannot call it old.

***

nobody knows her end.

上及有虞

and lived from the age of Shun
to the age of the Five Dictators.[^6-12]

奄有天下

who extended his rule over the whole world;
乘東維騎箕尾而比於列星
then Fu Yue climbed up to the Eastern Governor,
straddled the Winnowing Basket and the Tail,
and took his place among the ranks of stars.[^6-13]

南伯子葵問乎女偊曰
子之年長矣而色若孺子
Nanpo Zikui said to the Woman Crookback,
"You are old in years, and yet your complexion is that of a child.

何也
Why is this?"

***

曰吾聞道矣
"I have heard the Way!"

***

南伯子葵曰
道可得學邪
"Can the Way be learned?"
asked Nanpo Zikui.

***

曰惡惡可
"Goodness, how could that be?

子非其人也
Anyway, you aren't the man to do it.

夫卜梁倚
Now there's Buliang Yi---
有聖人之才而無聖人之道
我有聖人之道而無聖人之才
he has the talent of a sage but not the Way of a sage,
whereas I have the Way of a sage but not the talent of a sage.

吾欲以教之庶幾其果為聖人乎
I thought I would try to teach him
and see if I could really get anywhere near to making him a sage.

不然以聖人之道告聖人之才亦易矣
It's easier to explain the Way of a sage
to someone who has the talent of a sage, you know.

吾猶守而告之參日
而後能外天下
So I began explaining and kept at him for three days,[^6-14]
and after that he was able to put the world outside himself.

已外天下矣
吾又守之七日
而後能外物
When he had put the world outside himself,
I kept at him for seven days more,
and after that he was able to put things outside himself.

已外物矣
吾又守之九日
而後能外生
When he had put things outside himself,
I kept at him for nine days more,
and after that he was able to put life outside himself.

已外生矣而後能朝徹
朝徹而後能見獨
After he had put life outside himself,
he was able to achieve the brightness of dawn,
and when he had achieved the brightness of dawn,
he could see his own aloneness.

見獨而後能無古今
無古今而後能入於不死不生
After he had managed to see his own aloneness,
he could do away with past and present,
and after he had done away with past and present,
he was able to enter where there is no life and no death.

殺生者不死
That which kills life does not die;
生生者不生
that which gives life to life does not live.[^6-15]

其為物
This is the kind of thing it is:
無不將也
無不迎也
無不毀也
無不成也
there's nothing it doesn't send off,
nothing it doesn't welcome,
nothing it doesn't destroy,
nothing it doesn't complete.

其名為攖寧
Its name is Peace-in-Strife.

攖寧也者攖而後成者也
After the strife, it attains completion."

***

南伯子葵曰
子獨惡乎聞之
Nanpo Zikui asked,
"Where did you happen to hear this?"

***

曰聞諸副墨之子
"I heard it from the son of Aided-by-Ink,
副墨之子聞諸洛誦之孫
and Aided-by-Ink
heard it from the grandson of Repeated-Recitation,
洛誦之孫聞之瞻明

heard it from Seeing-Brightly,
瞻明聞之聶許

子祀子輿
子犁子來
四人相與語
Master Si, Master Yu,
Master Li, and Master Lai
were all four talking together.

曰孰能
以無為首
以生為脊
以死為尻
"Who can look on nonbeing as his head,
on life as his back,
and on death as his rump?" they said.

孰知生死存亡之一體者
"Who knows that life and death, existence and annihilation,
are all a single body?

吾與之友矣
I will be his friend!"

***

四人相視而笑
The four men looked at one another and smiled.

莫逆於心遂相與為友
There was no disagreement in their hearts,
and so the four of them became friends.

***

俄而子輿有病
All at once, Master Yu fell ill.

子祀往問之
Master Si went to ask how he was.

曰偉哉
"Amazing!" said Master Yu.

夫造物者將以予為此拘拘也
"The Creator is making me all crookedy like this!

曲僂發背上有五管
My back sticks up like a hunchback,
and my vital organs are on top of me.

頤隱於齊
肩高於頂
句贅指天
My chin is hidden in my navel,
my shoulders are up above my head,
and my pigtail points at the sky.

陰陽之氣有沴
It must be some dislocation of the yin and yang!"

***

其心閒而無事
Yet he seemed calm at heart and unconcerned.

跰足而鑑於井曰
嗟乎
Dragging himself haltingly to the well,
he looked at his reflection and said,
"My, my!

夫造物者又將以予為此拘拘也
So the Creator is making me all crookedy like this!"

***

子祀曰
汝惡之乎
"Do you resent it?"
asked Master Si.

***

曰亡予何惡
"Why no, what would I resent?

浸假而化予之左臂以為雞
If the process continues, perhaps in time
he'll transform my left arm into a rooster.

予因以求時夜
In that case I'll keep watch during the night.

浸假而化予之右臂以為彈
予因以求鴞炙
Or perhaps in time
he'll transform my right arm into a cross-bow pellet,
and I'll shoot down an owl for roasting.

浸假而化予之尻以為輪
Or perhaps in time
he'll transform my buttocks into cartwheels.

以神為馬
予因以乘之
Then, with my spirit for a horse,
I'll climb up and go for a ride.

豈更駕哉
What need will I ever have for a carriage again?

***

且夫得者時也
"I received life because the time had come;
失者順也
I will lose it because the order of things passes on.

安時而處順哀樂不能入也
Be content with this time and dwell in this order,
and then neither sorrow nor joy can touch you.

此古之所謂縣解也
In ancient times this was called
the 'freeing of the bound.'

而不能自解者物有結之
There are those who cannot free themselves
because they are bound by things.

且夫物不勝天
But nothing can ever win against Heaven---
久矣
that's the way it's always been.

吾又何惡焉
What would I have to resent?"

***

俄而子來有病
Suddenly Master Lai grew ill.

喘喘然將死
Gasping and wheezing, he lay at the point of death.

其妻子環而泣之
His wife and children gathered round in a circle and began to cry.

子犁往問之曰
叱
Master Li, who had come to ask how he was, said,
"Shoo!

避
Get back!

無怛化
Don't disturb the process of change!"

***

倚其戶與之語
Then he leaned against the doorway and talked to Master Lai.

曰偉哉造物
"How marvelous the Creator is!

又將奚以汝為
What is he going to make out of you next?

將奚以汝適
Where is he going to send you?

以汝為鼠肝乎
Will he make you into a rat's liver?

以汝為蟲臂乎
Will he make you into a bug's arm?"

***

子來曰
父母於子東西南北唯命之從
Master Lai said,
"A child, obeying his father and mother,
goes wherever he is told, east or west, south or north.

陰陽
And the yin and yang---
於人不翅
於父母
how much more are they to a man than father or mother!

彼近吾死而我不聽我則悍矣
Now that they have brought me to the verge of death,
if I should refuse to obey them,
how perverse I would be!

彼何罪焉
What fault is it of theirs?

夫大塊
載我以形
勞我以生
佚我以老
息我以死
The Great Clod
burdens me with form,
labors me with life,
eases me in old age,
and rests me in death.

故善吾生者乃所以善吾死也
So if I think well of my life,
for the same reason I must think well of my death.

今之大冶鑄金金踊躍曰
我且必為鏌鋣
大冶必以為不祥之金
When a skilled smith is casting metal,
if the metal should leap up and say,
'I insist on being made into a Moye!' [^6-17]
he would surely regard it as very inauspicious metal indeed.

今一犯人之形而曰
人耳人耳
夫造化者必以為不祥之人
Now, having had the audacity
to take on human form once, if I should say,
'I don't want to be anything but a man! Nothing but a man!'
the Creator would surely regard me as
a most inauspicious sort of person.

今一
以天地為大鑪
以造化為大冶
So now I think of heaven and earth as a great furnace,
and the Creator as a skilled smith.

惡乎往而不可哉
Where could he send me that would not be all right?

成然寐
蘧然覺
I will go off to sleep peacefully,
and then with a start, I will wake up."

---

子桑戶
孟子反
子琴張
三人相與友曰
孰能相與於無相與
Master Sanghu, Mengzi Fan, and Master Qinzhang,
three friends, said to one another,
"Who can join with others without joining with others?

相為於無相為
Who can do with others without doing with others?

孰能登天遊霧
撓挑無極
相忘以生
無所終窮
Who can climb up to heaven and wander in the mists,
roam the infinite,
and forget life
forever and forever?"

三人相視而笑
The three men looked at one another and smiled.

莫逆於心遂相與友
There was no disagreement in their hearts,
and so they became friends.

***

莫然有閒而子桑戶死
After some time had passed without event, Master Sanghu died.

未葬孔子聞之
使子貢往侍事焉
He had not yet been buried when Confucius, hearing of his death,
sent Zigong to assist at the funeral.

或編曲
或鼓琴
When Zigong arrived, he found
one of the dead man's friends weaving frames for silkworms,
while the other strummed a lute.

相和而歌曰
Joining their voices, they sang this song:

***

嗟來桑戶乎
Ah, Sanghu!

嗟來桑戶乎
Ah, Sanghu!

而已反其真
而我猶為人猗
You have gone back to your true form
While we remain as men, O!

***

子貢趨而進曰
敢問
Zigong hastened forward and said,
"May I be so bold as to ask what sort of ceremony this is---
臨尸而歌禮乎
singing in the very presence of the corpse?"

***

二人相視而笑
The two men looked at each other and laughed.

曰是惡知禮意
"What does this man know of the meaning of ceremony?" they said.

***

子貢反以告孔子
Zigong returned and reported to Confucius what had happened.

曰彼何人者邪
"What sort of men are they, anyway?" he asked.

修行無有而外其形骸
臨尸而歌顏色不變
"They pay no attention to proper behavior,
disregard their personal appearance and,
without so much as changing the expression on their faces,
sing in the very presence of the corpse!

無以命之
I can think of no name for them!

彼何人者邪
What sort of men are they?"

***

孔子曰
彼遊方之外者也
"Such men as they,"
said Confucius,
"wander beyond the realm;
而丘游方之內者也
men like me wander within it.

外內不相及
Beyond and within can never meet.

而丘使女往弔之丘則陋矣
It was stupid of me to send you to offer condolences.

彼方且與造物者為人而遊乎天地之一氣
Even now they have joined with the Creator as men
to wander in the single breath of heaven and earth.

彼以生為附贅縣疣
以死為決𤴯[^rse-06-1]潰癰
They look on life as a swelling tumor, a protruding wen,
and on death as the draining of a sore or the bursting of a boil.

夫若然者又惡知死生先後之所在
To men such as these,
how could there be any question of putting life first or death last?

假於異物託於同體
They borrow the forms of different creatures
and house them in the same body.

忘其肝膽
遺其耳目
反覆終始
不知端倪
They forget liver and gall,
cast aside ears and eyes,
turning and revolving, ending and beginning again,
unaware of where they start or finish.

芒然彷徨乎塵垢之外
Idly they roam beyond the dust and dirt;
逍遙乎無為之業
they wander free and easy in the service of inaction.

彼又惡能憒憒然為世俗之禮
以觀眾人之耳目哉
Why should they fret and fuss
about the ceremonies of the vulgar world
and make a display for the ears and eyes of the common herd?"

***

子貢曰
然則夫子何方之依
Zigong said,
"Well then, Master, what is this 'realm' that you stick to?"

***

孔子曰
丘天之戮民也
Confucius said,
"I am one of those men punished by Heaven.

雖然吾與汝共之
Nevertheless, I will share with you what I have."

***

子貢曰
敢問其方
"Then may I ask about the realm?" [^6-18]
said Zigong.

***

孔子曰
魚相造乎水
人相造乎道
Confucius said,
"Fish thrive in water,
man thrives in the Way.

相造乎水者
穿池而養給
For those that thrive in water,
dig a pond, and they will find nourishment enough.

相造乎道者
無事而生定
For those that thrive in the Way,
don't bother about them, and their lives will be secure.

故曰
魚相忘乎江湖
人相忘乎道術
So it is said,
the fish forget one another in the rivers and lakes,
and men forget one another in the arts of the Way."

***

子貢曰
敢問畸人
Zigong said,
"May I ask about the singular man?"

***

曰畸人者
畸於人而侔於天
"The singular man
is singular in comparison to other men,
but a companion of Heaven.

故曰
天之小人人之君子
So it is said,
the petty man of Heaven is a gentleman among men;
人之君子天之小人也
the gentleman among men is the petty man of Heaven."

顏回問仲尼曰
孟孫才其母死
哭泣無涕
Yan Hui said to Confucius,
"When Mengsun Cai's mother died,
he wailed without shedding any tears;
中心不戚
he did not grieve in his heart;
居喪不哀
and he conducted the funeral without any look of sorrow.

無是三者以善處喪蓋魯國
He fell down on these three counts,
and yet he is known all over the state of Lu
for the excellent way he managed the funeral.

固有無其實而得其名者乎
Is it really possible to gain such a reputation
when there are no facts to support it?

回壹怪之
I find it very peculiar indeed!"

***

仲尼曰
夫孟孫氏盡之矣
Confucius said,
"Mengsun did all there was to do.

進於知矣唯簡之而不得
He was advanced beyond ordinary understanding,
and he would have simplified things even more,
but that wasn't practical.

夫已有所簡矣
However, there is still a lot that he simplified.

孟孫氏
不知所以生
不知所以死
Mengsun doesn't know why he lives
and doesn't know why he dies.

不知就先
He doesn't know why he should go ahead;
不知就後
he doesn't know why he should fall behind.

若化為物
以待其所不知之化已乎
In the process of change, he has become a thing
[among other things],
and he is merely waiting for some other change
that he doesn't yet know about.

且方將化惡知不化哉
Moreover, when he is changing,
how does he know that he really is changing?

方將不化惡知已化哉
And when he is not changing,
how does he know that he hasn't already changed?

吾特與汝
You and I, now---
其夢未始覺者邪
we are dreaming and haven't waked up yet.

且彼
有駭形而無損心
有旦宅而無情死
But in his case,
though something may startle his body,
it won't injure his mind;
though something may alarm the house [his spirit lives in],
his emotions will suffer no death.

孟孫氏特覺
Mengsun alone has waked up.

人哭亦哭
Men wail and so he wails, too---
是自其所以乃
that's the reason he acts like this.

***

且也相與吾之耳矣
"What's more, we go around telling one another,
I do this, I do that---
庸詎知吾所謂吾之乎
but how do we know that this 'I' we talk about has any 'I' to it?

且汝夢為鳥而厲乎天
You dream you're a bird and soar up into the sky;
夢為魚而沒於淵
you dream you're a fish and dive down in the pool.

不識今之言者
其覺者乎
夢者乎
But now when you tell me about it,
I don't know whether you are awake
or whether you are dreaming.

造適不及笑
Running around accusing others[^6-19] is not as good as laughing,
獻笑不及排
and enjoying a good laugh is not as good as going along with things.

安排而去化
乃入於寥天一
Be content to go along and forget about change,
and then you can enter the mysterious oneness of Heaven."

意而子見許由
Yi Erzi went to see Xu You.[^6-20]

許由曰
堯何以資汝
Xu You said,
"What kind of assistance has Yao been giving you?"

***

意而子曰
堯謂我
汝必躬服仁義而明言是非
Yi Erzi said,
"Yao told me,
'You must learn to practice benevolence and righteousness
and to speak clearly about right and wrong!'"

***

許由曰
而奚為來軹
"Then why come to see *me*?"
said Xu You.

夫堯既已
黥汝以仁義而劓汝以是非矣
"Yao has already
tattooed you with benevolence and righteousness
and cut off your nose with right and wrong.[^6-21]

汝將何以遊
夫遙蕩恣睢轉徙之途乎
Now how do you expect to go wandering
in any faraway, carefree, and as-you-like-it paths?"

***

意而子曰
雖然
"That may be,"
said Yi Erzi.

吾願遊於其藩
"But I would like, if I may,
to wander in a little corner of them."

***

許由曰
不然
"Impossible!"
said Xu You.

夫盲者無以與乎眉目顏色之好
"Eyes that are blind have no way to tell
the loveliness of faces and features;
瞽者無以與乎青黃黼黻之觀
eyes with no pupils have no way to tell
the beauty of colored and embroidered silks."

***

意而子曰
夫無莊之失其美
據梁之失其力
黃帝之亡其知
Yi Erzi said,
"Yes, but Wuzhuang forgot her beauty,
Juliang forgot his strength,
and the Yellow Emperor forgot his wisdom---
皆在鑪捶之間耳
all were content to be recast and remolded.[^6-22]

庸詎知夫造物者之
不息我黥而補我劓
使我乘成以隨先生邪
How do you know that the Creator
will not wipe away my tattoo, stick my nose back on again,
and let me ride on the process of completion
and follow after you, Master?"

***

許由曰
噫未可知也
"Ah---we can never tell,"
said Xu You.

我為汝言其大略
"I will just speak to you about the general outline.

吾師乎
吾師乎
This Teacher of mine,
this Teacher of mine---
齏萬物而不為義
he passes judgment on the ten thousand things,
but he doesn't think himself righteous;
澤及萬世而不為仁
his bounty extends to ten thousand generations,
but he doesn't think himself benevolent.

長於上古而不為老
He is older than the highest antiquity,
but he doesn't think himself long-lived;
覆載天地
刻彫眾形而不為巧
he covers heaven, bears up the earth, 
carves and fashions countless forms,
but he doesn't think himself skilled.

此所遊已
It is with him alone I wander."

顏回曰
回益矣
Yan Hui said,
"I'm improving!"

***

仲尼曰
何謂也
Confucius said,
"What do you mean by that?"

***

曰回忘仁義矣
"I've forgotten benevolence and righteousness!"

***

曰可矣
"That's good.

猶未也
But you still haven't got it."

***

他日復見曰
回益矣
Another day, the two met again, and Yan Hui said,
"I'm improving!"

***

曰何謂也
"What do you mean by that?"

***

曰回忘禮樂矣
"I've forgotten rites and music!"

***

曰可矣
"That's good.

猶未也
But you still haven't got it."

***

他日復見曰
回益矣
Another day, the two met again, and Yan Hui said,
"I'm improving!"

***

曰何謂也
"What do you mean by that?"

***

曰回坐忘矣
"I can sit down and forget everything!"

***

仲尼蹴然曰
何謂坐忘
Confucius looked very startled and said,
"What do you mean, sit down and forget everything?"

***

顏回曰
墮肢體
黜聰明
離形去知
同於大通
Yan Hui said,
"I smash up my limbs and body,
drive out perception and intellect,
cast off form, do away with understanding,
and make myself identical with the Great Thoroughfare.

此謂坐忘
This is what I mean by sitting down and forgetting everything."

***

仲尼曰
同則無好也
Confucius said,
"If you're identical with it, you must have no more likes!

化則無常也
If you've been transformed, you must have no more constancy!

而果其賢乎
So you really are a worthy man after all![^6-23]

丘也請從而後也
With your permission, I'd like to become your follower."

子輿與子桑友
Master Yu and Master Sang were friends.

而霖雨十日
Once, it rained incessantly for ten days.

子輿曰
子桑殆病矣
裹飯而往食之
Master Yu said to himself,
Master Sang is probably having a bad time,
and he wrapped up some rice and took it for his friend to eat.

至子桑之門則若歌若哭鼓琴曰
When he got to Master Sang's gate,
he heard something like singing or crying
and someone striking a lute and saying:

***

父邪
Father?

母邪
Mother?

天乎
Heaven?

人乎
Man?

***

有不任其聲而趨舉其詩焉
It was as though the voice would not hold out
and the singer were rushing to get through the words.

***

子輿入曰
子之歌詩
Master Yu went inside and said,
"What do you mean---
何故若是
singing a song like that!"

***

曰吾思乎
使我至此極者而弗得也
"I was pondering what it is
that has brought me to this extremity,
but I couldn't find the answer.

父母豈欲吾貧哉
My father and mother surely wouldn't wish this poverty on me.

天無私覆
Heaven covers all without partiality;
地無私載
earth bears up all without partiality---
天地豈私貧我哉
heaven and earth surely wouldn't single me out to make me poor.

求其為之者而不得也
I try to discover who is doing it, but I can't get the answer.

然而至此極者
Still, here I am---at the very extreme.

命也夫
It must be fate."
